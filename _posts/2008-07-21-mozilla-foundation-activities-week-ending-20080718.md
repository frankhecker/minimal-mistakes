This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending July 18, 2008.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the blogs published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Future of the Foundation

	
    * Mitchell Baker [announced](http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2008/07/17/mark-surman-and-the-mozilla-foundation/) that [Mark Surman](http://commonspace.typepad.com/commonspace/) is being considered for the Foundation executive director position.

	
    * David posted a [blog entry](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2008/07/14/supporting-the-mozilla-community/) with ideas about how the Foundation might support the Mozilla community.




	
  * Legal issues

	
    * Gerv [called](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/2008/07/signing_the_new_contributors_agreement.html) for people to sign committer's agreements at the Firefox Summit.




	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * The Mozilla Foundation is sponsoring the [2009 Foundations of Open Media Software workshop](http://www.foms-workshop.org/foms2009/).

	
    * Wellington Fernando de Macedo has made further progress on his Foundation-funded server-sent DOM events project; see bug [338583](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=338583) for more information.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I gave final approval for two requests from [GlobalSign](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#GlobalSign) (bugs [406794](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=406794) and [406796](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=406796)) and filed bug [446407](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=446407) against NSS and bug [446409](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=446407) against PSM for the actual code changes.

	
    * I started the first public comment period for requests from [Comodo](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#Comodo) (for a new ECC root, bug [421946](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=421946)), [Deutsche Telekom/T-Systems](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#T-Systems) (bug [378882](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=378882)), and [Wells Fargo](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#Wells%20Fargo) (bug [428390](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=428390)).

	
    * I worked with Kathleen Wilson to select the next group of CAs for which to process requests and do information gathering.




	
  * Public communication

	
    * David arranged for printing copies of the [Mozilla brochure](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2008/07/10/mozilla-brochure-10/) for OSCON, and started work on a brochure page for www.mozilla.org.

	
    * David prepared for a [session on the www.mozilla.org site](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Summit2008/Sessions/Proposals/Mozilla.org_Site) at the upcoming Firefox Summit.

	
    * David updated the [About page](http://www.mozilla.org/about) on www.mozilla.org to keep it in sync with the last round of changes to the text of the Mozilla brochure.




	
  * Conferences

	
    * Zak continued working on the proposed [FOSSCoach](http://fosscoach.wikia.com/wiki/FOSSCoach) event at OSCON and related activities, including drafting the schedule and helping to orient the event coaches and participants.




	
  * Other

	
    * Gerv met with various people about proposed Site Security Policy implementations.







#### Upcoming events and activities





	
  * David, Gerv, and Zak will be attending OSCON (July 21-25 in Portland OR) and the Firefox Summit (July 29-31 in Whistler BC).

	
  * I will be attending the Firefox Summit but not OSCON, and then will be on vacation for most of the following week.
