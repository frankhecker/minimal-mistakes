What will be built in phase 2 of the Crescent development? In this post I continue my discussion of key slides from the slide presentation given by John DeWolf of Howard Hughes Corporation at the [pre-submission meeting on March 31](/2014/04/01/no-fooling-columbias-becoming-a-city/); for more background see my overview of the [areas and phases of development](/2014/04/06/the-crescent-development-in-downtown-columbia-areas-and-phases/) and my [previous post on phase 1](/2014/04/07/the-crescent-development-in-downtown-columbia-phase-1). As before, the usual caveats apply: some of these details may change somewhat prior to the next step in the Howard County approval process, and some may have changed already prior to the pre-submission meeting but after the slide presentation was prepared.

The second key slide in John DeWolf’s presentation was titled “Crescent Neighborhood, Phase 2—1.35 million SF*”; the asterisk referenced a note at the bottom of the slide, “As shown in plan”.1 The graphical portion of the slide showed the following _new_ structures within the four areas, in addition to those constructed in phase 1 and shown in the first key slide:



	
  * Area 1

	
    * A new office building in the eastern part of the area, joining the previous office building constructed in phase 1.

	
    * A new parking garage immediately to the west of the new office building, bordering the east side of Broken Land Parkway. This garage was shown as replacing the northern half of the surface parking lot constructed in phase 1.

	
    * A surface parking lot immediately to the south of the new parking garage, bordering the east side of Broken Land Parkway. This was shown as the remaining southern half of the surface parking lot constructed in phase 1.




	
  * Area 2

	
    * A new office building in the southern part of the area, immediately to the east of the office building constructed in phase 1 and to the north of the proposed street between Broken Land Parkway and the proposed Crescent West ring road.

	
    * A new parking garage immediately to the north of the two office buildings, bordering Broken Land Parkway. This garage and the new office building were shown as replacing the western portion of the surface parking lot constructed in phase 1.

	
    * A surface parking lot occupying the eastern portion of the area. This was shown as the remaining eastern portion of the surface parking lot constructed in phase 1.




	
  * Area 3

	
    * Two new residential buildings in the north central part of the area, immediately to the east of the easternmost of the two residential buildings constructed in phase 1, south of Crescent West, and west of the proposed South Crescent Promenade, a pedestrian pathway next to another street from Crescent West into Area 3.2




	
  * Area 4

	
    * This area was shown as remaining undeveloped during this phase.





The remainder of the slide contained a table showing the space usage and other details of the proposed structures; note that these numbers represent both new construction in phase 2 and (where noted) construction in phase 1:

Note that a total of approximately 7,280 parking spaces (in both garages and surface lots) were shown as being available as a result of construction in phase 2. It’s unclear how many of these spaces might be made available for attendees at events at Merriweather Post Pavilion or in Symphony Woods. Also note that this figure is considerably higher than the figure of 4,360 total parking spaces quoted in [Luke Lavoie’s April 1 story](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/columbia/ph-ho-cf-crescent-meeting-20140331,0,925474.story) in the Baltimore Sun; it’s unclear what the source of the discrepancy might be.

Finally, note that two parcels in Area 3 were shown as remaining undeveloped during phase 2. (The remaining parcel was shown as being replaced by the two new residential buildings.) As I noted in my previous post, it’s unclear whether or not some portion of these parcels might be made available for Merriweather event parking during phase 2 construction.

In my next post I’ll present the details for phase 3.

1. It’s unclear exactly which plan this note is referring to.

2.  Although not shown on this slide, based on other slides in the presentation at least one and possibly both of these residential buildings are proposed to contain an above-ground parking garage.

3. This represents parking spaces in the parking garage constructed in Area 1 in phase 1.

4. This line was almost illegible on the slide. I am guessing that approximately 120 spaces would remain in the portion of the surface parking lot in Area 1 that was not replaced by a parking garage in phase 2.

5. This represents parking spaces in the parking garage constructed in Area 2 in phase 1.

6. This line was almost illegible on the slide. I am guessing that approximately 200 spaces would remain in the portion of the surface parking lot in Area 2 that was not replaced by a parking garage in phase 2.

7. This represents parking spaces in the parking garages constructed in Area 3 in phase 1.
