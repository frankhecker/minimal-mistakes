This is a personal unofficial blog about life as an [eMusic](http://www.emusic.com/) subscriber, with a particular focus on eMusic as a business in relation to the digital music industry as a whole.

Note that I have no connection with eMusic except as a satisfied customer. I express my own opinions on this blog, which have nothing to do with those of my employer, eMusic, or anyone else.
