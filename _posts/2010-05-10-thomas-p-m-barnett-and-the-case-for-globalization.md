I have a fondness for big thinkers and theories that attempt to reflect, integrate, and address a wide variety of phenomena. In the area of national security (broadly defined) my favorite guru is [Thomas P.M. Barnett](http://thomaspmbarnett.com/). Those looking for a concise summary of his self-described calling as grand strategist and his view of the world in the 21st century (including America's critical role within it) should check out an [interview with Barnett](http://thomaspmbarnett.com/weblog/2010/05/enlightennext_interview_text_n.html) that appeared in [EnlightenNext magazine](http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/), along with the accompanying [introduction](http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j44/barnett.asp?page=1).

An interesting subtext here is, why is Barnett giving interviews to a publication concerned with [evolutionary spirituality and related topics](http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/misc/about-wie.asp?ifr=util)? I don't think this is a case of Barnett going all new age on us, but rather is a conscious strategy on his part that is consistent with his ideas on globalization and national security. I hope to have more to say on this in a future blog post.
