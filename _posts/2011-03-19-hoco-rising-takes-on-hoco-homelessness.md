HoCo Rising has been teasing us all week about his big announcement. It turned out that he's not just raising consciousness through his blog but he's also raising money, in this case to [help eliminate homelessness in Howard County](http://www.hocorising.com/2011/03/breaking-through.html). It's a worthy cause, and the recipient of the funds, the [Grassroots Crisis Intervention Center](http://www.grassrootscrisis.org/), is a worthy organization. I just donated $50 (which I'm proud to say put the campaign past the halfway mark on the way to the goal of raising $1,500) and I encourage you to [donate](http://www.crowdrise.com/therising) too if you haven't already.
