Just a quick note to let all of you know that I'll soon be leaving the Mozilla Foundation to take a new position as a sales engineer in the Federal sales group at [IronKey](https://www.ironkey.com/). My last day at the Foundation will be Friday, December 11. Those of you with whom I worked pre-Mozilla know that this is a return to what I've done for most of my career (and I'll be working with folks I've enjoyed working with previously). It's been fun and interesting to work at Mozilla, but it's time to move on. 

I'm spending my last few days at the Foundation working on transitioning my various duties to others and helping out with planning for 2010. If there's anything you need from me before I leave, please contact me in the next few days. After December 11 you can reach me at hecker@hecker.org; my work address will be fhecker@ironkey.com if you want to contact me on IronKey-related matters.

I appreciate all the help and support I've gotten from other folks at Mozilla. I'm sorry I won't be able to thank all of you personally, and I won't be at the Mozilla all-hands meeting next week so I won't be able to say good-bye in person. I  wish you all the best of luck in your endeavors, and look forward to seeing all the great things coming from Mozilla over the next year, from new releases of Firefox and Thunderbird to the start of Mozilla Drumbeat.
