As you'll know if you read my [last post](/2013/06/03/repairing-my-personal-infrastructure/), I decided to stop blogging for a while to save wear and tear on my shoulder. However as it happened I got a phone call from Nuance, the makers of [Dragon Dictate for Mac](http://www.nuance.com/for-individuals/by-product/dragon-for-mac/dragon-dictate/index.htm), who were trying to get me to upgrade to the new version of the product that I purchased a few years ago. It was a reasonably good deal and I thought it was worth trying out, so I took advantage of the offer.

I was quite pleasantly surprised. It turns out that voice recognition software has gotten a lot better since I last used it a few years ago. The recognition rate is quite high although not perfect; it's  certainly good enough to do informal blog posts.

So I'm going to try doing some blogging using this new technology. It will be interesting, because it's harder to compose one's thoughts when dictating than it is when writing by hand. That may make for more spontaneous posts, or it may make for more incoherent ones. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

P.S. This entire post was composed using Dragon Dictate, except for my having go back in a few places and correct mistakes by hand.
