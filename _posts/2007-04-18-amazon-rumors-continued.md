Courtesy of Hypebot's [New Music Business Briefing](http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/typepad/DqMf/~3/109657268/new_music_busin_11.html) this week: The mainstream music industry press (in the form of Billboard) talks about [the possibility of Amazon entering the digital music market](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070416/wr_nm/mp3_dc). Some quick points, for those keeping score at home:



	
  * Hypebot brags that they've been out in front on the Amazon story for some time now. Fair play to them, they've done a good job of keeping up to date with Amazon-related developments.

	
  * Billboard revisits the complaints of the major labels that Amazon wasn't willing to take on Apple with a DRM-based offering. Sorry, folks, I pointed out over a year ago [what a stupid idea that was](http://internet.seekingalpha.com/article/7141), especially given that Amazon is in business to serve its customers, not the business models of the major labels.

	
  * As [I predicted](http://swindleeeee.com/2007/04/07/amazon-predictions-part-2-selling-digital-music-and-cds-together/), Amazon has at least been trying to establish price points for a la carte downloads below the prevailing $0.99 per track model (which in turn is based on a wholesale price to labels of $0.70 per track). However Amazon is encountering resistance, and it's not clear if it will be successful, at least initially.


Interesting times. But enough Amazon for now; this is an eMusic blog, so I'll try to post on eMusic next.
