As of today I'm officially migrating from my old personal blog at `http://hecker.org/` and publicizing the new blog at `[http://blog.hecker.org/](http://blog.hecker.org/)`. (This new blog is actually hosted at [wordpress.com](http://www.wordpress.com/), but I'm using a hecker.org subdomain in case I want to move it to another service or server in future.) Most of the posts on this blog have been Mozilla-related, and I anticipate that continuing; I maintain an intermittently-updated hobby blog at a [different domain](http://swindleeeee.com/), but I don't have the spare time to publish much other non-Mozilla stuff. If you want to see only Mozilla-related posts, subscribe to the Mozilla feed at `[http://blog.hecker.org/category/mozilla/feed/](http://blog.hecker.org/category/mozilla/feed/)`; if you don't mind seeing non-Mozilla stuff occasionally you can subscribe to `[http://blog.hecker.org/feed/](http://blog.hecker.org/feed/)` instead. Finally, my Mozilla blog posts also get syndicated throughÂ [planet.mozilla.org](http://planet.mozilla.org/), so if you subscribe to the p.m.o feed you don't need to subscribe to this blog's Mozilla feed separately.
