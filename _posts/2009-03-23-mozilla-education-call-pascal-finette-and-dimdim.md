For [this week's instance](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/StatusMeetings/2009-03-23) of our [weekly Mozilla Education call](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/StatusMeetings) we have a presentation from Pascal Finette on the online course being done for the Mozilla Labs Design Challenge. The online portion of the course is being done using [WebEx](http://www.webex.com/), and Pascal will (among other things) talk about their experiences using WebEx for online presentations and communication. We're looking at [Dimdim](http://www.dimdim.com/) as a (partially) open source alternative to WebEx, and are using Pascal's presentation as an opportunity to do a live test of Dimdim. We'd like to get as many attendees involved as we can, in order to do a proper test, so please attend this call if you can!
