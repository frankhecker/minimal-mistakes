This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending April 25, 2008. (Yes, I'm somewhat behind again on status reports, but will catch up again today.)


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on that week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * I worked on one grant approved but not yet finalized, and another larger accessibility-related grant not yet approved.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I gave preliminary approval to the request from [DigiNotar](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#DigiNotar) to add a new root and enable it for EV; for more information see bug [369357](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=369357).




	
  * Public communications and related issues

	
    * David and I participated in activities related to the [Powered by Mozilla program](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2008/04/18/moving-forward-with-powered-by-mozilla/).

	
    * David made some additional changes to drafts of new Community pages for www.mozilla.org.
