This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending April 11, 2008. (I'm now caught up on status reports.) Note that I was out almost all week taking care of family medical matters, so the report is somewhat skimpy.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * The Mozilla Foundation will be sponsoring some Mozilla accessibility developers to attend the [SightCity conference](http://www.sightcity.net/index-e.html) and meet with Marco Zehe and Aaron Leventhal.

	
    * Mozdev published its [2007 annual report](http://www.mozdev.org/about/mco2007_annualreport.pdf).




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I corresponded with some people who can potentially help with processing CA applications, and set up some calls to discuss next steps.




	
  * Public communications and related issues

	
    * David did more work on revising the www.mozilla.org site, including updating the ["About" page](http://www.mozilla.org/about).
