This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending July 11, 2008.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the blogs published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Legal issues

	
    * Gerv worked on a variety of licensing issues involving software to be used in the context of the Mozilla project.




	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * Gerv contacted the various people involved in Google Summer of Code projects related to Mozilla in order to get current status reports.

	
    * The Mozilla Foundation is funding a new project by [Eitan Isaacson](http://monotonous.org/) to do comparison testing of accessibility support for Firefox and other browsers.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I gave preliminary approval for two requests from [GlobalSign](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#GlobalSign) (bugs [406794](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=406794) and[406796](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=406796)) and started the second (and last) public comment period.




	
  * Public communication

	
    * David posted version 1.0 of the [Mozilla brochure](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2008/07/10/mozilla-brochure-10/), and worked to get copies printed for OSCON.

	
    * David took part in a [discussion on the Mozilla governance list](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.governance/browse_thread/thread/c80ae5a9d622bc6a#) about where policy documents should live and how they should be maintained.




	
  * Conferences

	
    * Zak continued working on the proposed [FOSSCoach](http://fosscoach.wikia.com/wiki/FOSSCoach) event at OSCON and related activities, including drafting the schedule and helping to orient the event coaches and participants.




	
  * Other

	
    * Gerv continued a discussion on [how to to gather ISP configuration data for Thunderbird autoconfig](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.thunderbird/browse_thread/thread/3ffeff561786e5fe/), and [created a Google Spreadsheet with proposed data to collect](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.thunderbird/browse_thread/thread/89c5a8a129f9af83/).

	
    * Gerv attended the [party for the presentation of the Firefox Guinness world record certificate](http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2008/07/10/mozillas-guinness-world-record-certificate/), where he can be seen trying to peer over Tristan's left shoulder.







#### Upcoming events and activities
