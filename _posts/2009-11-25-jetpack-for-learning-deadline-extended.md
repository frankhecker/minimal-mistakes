Do you have a great idea for a [Jetpack](http://) or [Firefox extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Extensions) to help support learning online? Would you like a chance to attend an intensive Jetpack design camp in Austin TX _and_ stay over to attend [SXSW Interactive](http://sxsw.com/interactive/)? Then you have less than a week left to send in your submission for the [Jetpack for Learning Design Challenge](http://design-challenge.mozilla.org/jetpack-for-learning/).

To give you a little more time to prepare your submission, we're extending the deadline for submissions to midnight (Pacific time) on Monday, November 30. If you're in the US please relax and enjoy your Thanksgiving dinner before you send in your submission, and no matter where you live feel free to take time this weekend to polish it.
