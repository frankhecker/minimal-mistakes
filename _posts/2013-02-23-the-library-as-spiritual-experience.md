I think this is a record for me: Three posts in one day, and all about libraries to boot, to mark the occasion of the “[Evening in the Stacks](http://www.hclibrary.org/index.php?page=330)” fundraising event at the Miller Branch of the Howard County Library System.

After finishing my [last post](/2013/02/23/turbocharging-downtown-columbia-with-a-new-central-branch-library/) I happened to be thinking of the role that libraries play in the life of their communities and how libraries are portrayed in TV and films: as just another setting for sitcom wisecracking and rom-com “meeting cute”, or perhaps as a place to go to discover mysterious dark secrets leading to overblown action sequences--what I’ll call the “Indiana Jones” or Da Vinci Code perspective.

As an antidote to all that I present possibly the most beautiful cinematic scene ever set in a library, from the Wim Wenders film [Wings of Desire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wings_of_Desire) (Der Himmel über Berlin), as angels (the men and women in long coats and scarves) visit the [Berlin State Library](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin_State_Library) (Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin) and overhear the thoughts of the patrons as they read.
