For [this weekâ€™s instance](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/StatusMeetings/2009-05-11) of our [weekly Mozilla Education call](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/StatusMeetings) we'll be talking about our efforts to expand and revision the [education.mozilla.org](http://education.mozilla.org/) (EDMO) web site. The discussion will be led by [James Boston](http://jamesboston.ca/cms/), our new Mozilla Education intern. For some background on what James will be doing this summer, please see his [blog post](http://jamesboston.ca/cms/?q=node/123).
