_This is part 1 of a four-part series, continued in part 2, part 3, and part 4._

In recent weeks I've read the essays in the [online symposium on John Tomasi's book Free Market Fairness](http://bleedingheartlibertarians.com/2012/06/introduction-to-the-symposium-on-john-tomasis-free-market-fairness/) at the Bleeding Heart Libertarians group blog. I've previously noted [why I think the book and its topic are important](/2012/06/10/free-market-fairness-a-philosophy-for-the-21st-century/). But what exactly is "free market fairness"? It is Tomasi's particular take on a broader concept he calls "market democracy":
.


<blockquote>Market democracy is a deliberative form of liberalism that is sensitive to the moral insights of libertarianism. Market democracy combines ... four ideas ...: (1) capitalistic economic freedoms as vital aspects of liberty, (2) society as a spontaneous order, (3) just and legitimate political institutions as acceptable to all who make their lives among them, and (4) social justice as the ultimate standard of political evaluation.</blockquote>



This paragraph packs a lot into a few words, and it will take me a few blog posts to unpack it and give my personal thoughts from my perspective as someone who's not a professional (or even amateur) philosopher, but is interested in this general line of thought.

The first sentence situates Tomasi's project in the general history and taxonomy of political philosophy. The main point of interest to non-philosophers is that there's actually a common intellectual heritage between political "liberals" in the U.S. sense (i.e., those generally supportive of government and its associated regulatory and redistribution schemes) and those who oppose them and call for less government and freer markets. Tomasi's goal is to draw upon that common heritage and create a hybrid philosophy that acknowledges the importance of the free market but does not dismiss the concerns of those concerned with "social justice" in the general sense. The first two ideas of market democracy come out of the "classic liberal" and libertarian traditions, and the second two from the "modern" or "high liberal" tradition.

Let's start with the first idea, "capitalistic economic freedoms as vital aspects of liberty". By this Tomasi means that the freedom to engage in typical capitalist activities--owning private property (including the "means of production"), starting a business, producing products and services and selling them in the market, accumulating wealth as a reward for one's efforts--should be thought of as equally important as other freedoms, for example the freedom to freely speak one's mind, to practice a religion (or not worship at all), and so on. (Think of all the freedoms addressed in the Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution.)

Tomasi and others have crafted sophisticated philosophical arguments for why economic freedoms of this type should be viewed as equally important as freedom of speech, religion, etc. Some people have further argued that economic freedoms are in fact the fundamental freedoms, even more important than the others. (As Tomasi points out, this is pretty much the defining belief of libertarians.) Others have created equally sophisticated arguments for why economic freedoms really aren't basic. Since I'm not equipped to adequately evaluate and critique all the philosophical arguments, I'll fall back on two less-sophisticated arguments, one resting on history and the other on our moral sense.

First, although the modern institutions of capitalism (e.g., the joint stock corporation) date back only a few hundred years, humans have engaged in economic activities beyond simple hunting, gathering, and farming for thousands of years, as people moved into cities and began to specialize in certain economic niches, including working as artisans and merchants. (Some think trade in the sense of long-distance exchange of goods started more than a hundred thousand years ago.) In ancient times there were even entire societies oriented around trade, such as the Phoenicians (who gave us our alphabet). Viewed from this perspective capitalism isn't some alien scheme overlaid on our real human nature. Rather it's an outgrowth of human activities at least as old as organized religion, and like religion those activities have deeply influenced human society and are key to how we conceive of ourselves.

When economic freedoms are egregiously violated it can therefore seem as severe a violation of our integrity as persons as when we are persecuted for our religion or for the things we say. Consider the Arab Spring, which most people now think of (if they think of it at all) as a straightforward struggle of people for democracy and against dictatorship, now potentially hijacked by Islamists seeking to translate religion feelings into political power. But the original spark of the Arab Spring had nothing to do with promoting democracy or Islam. It was the anger and frustration of Mohamed Bouazizi, "a Tunisian street vendor who set himself on fire on 17 December 2010, in protest of the confiscation of his wares and the harassment and humiliation that he reported was inflicted on him by a municipal official and her aides" (to quote Wikipedia). While some of the details of Bouazizi's story remain fuzzy (was street vending actually illegal, or just obstructed by corrupt police officers in search of bribes? did the official actually slap Bouazizi or not?), there's no doubt that the root of Bouazizi's protest was his need and desire to provide for his family, and the obstruction of that quest by agents of the state.

The people of Tunisia responded to Mohamed Bouazizi's act with protests of their own, which in turn inspired protests in other countries. While the motivations of the protestors differed, a common theme was anger at governments that did not provide economic opportunities for the people subject to their rule. Bouazizi's story affected the protestors in the same general way that the death of religious martyrs or attacks on civil rights protesters have affected people; many if not most people saw and see all of these as morally equivalent in some deep sense. This felt sense of moral equivalence is a key argument (and perhaps the most basic argument) for treating economic freedom as equally important to other freedoms.

Note that believing in this equivalency still leaves plenty of room for disagreement. For example, as Tomasi notes, there's a difference between believing that economic freedom is of equal importance to other freedoms and believing that economic freedom is the most important freedom, or even the only freedom that truly matters. We can be liberals (in the classic sense) without being libertarians. We also don't have to judge all restrictions on economic freedom as equally bad, to believe (for example) that the imposition of a particular regulation or an increase in a particular tax rate carries anywhere near the moral weight of what was done to Mohamed Bouazizi. Finally, although the right of people to join together in corporations in pursue of economic goals is an important fundamental right, we don't necessarily have to treat corporations as completely equivalent to individuals in all respects.

What we do have to do, however, is to treat economic freedoms with respect, and to require reasonable justifications for government actions that would restrict them. Again, we can disagree as to what exactly "reasonable" means in this context, with different people making different arguments as to what restrictions on economic freedoms count as unacceptable. My point is simply that we cannot simply dismiss those who feel their economic freedoms are being violated in various ways, any more than we can dismiss those concerned about their political, religious, or other freedoms.

This completes my thoughts on the first of Tomasi's core ideas of market democracy; I'll take up the second idea, society as a spontaneous order, in my next post.
