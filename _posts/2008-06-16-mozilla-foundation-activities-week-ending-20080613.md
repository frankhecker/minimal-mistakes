This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending June 13, 2008.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * I updated the list of [Mozilla Foundations grants and related expenditures for 2007](http://blog.hecker.org/2007/11/19/mozilla-foundation-grants-and-related-expenditures-for-2007/) to include all items approved in 2007.

	
    * Gary Bishop of the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill published information on the [atool](http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/%7Egb/wp/blog/2008/06/12/atool-enables-ddr-pad-or-webcam-input/) project, a follow-on project to an earlier Mozilla Foundation-funded project to enable people with physical disabilities to do keyboard input using commodity webcam hardware.




	
  * Legal issues

	
    * Gerv published the new [Mozilla committer's agreement](http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/committer/committers-agreement.pdf) and [related information](http://www.mozilla.org/hacking/committer/faq.html) on the www.mozilla.org site.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * Kathleen Wilson updated the [pending CA request list](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/) to reflect current information received from CAs; she's still waiting on information from several CAs.




	
  * Public communication

	
    * David participated in a [planning meeting on www.mozilla.org changes](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.mozilla-org/browse_thread/thread/252eece4039d39b3#).

	
    * David also had a call with the evangelism team about community content ideas for www.mozilla.org.




	
  * Conferences

	
    * Zak continued work on the proposed [FOSSCoach](http://fosscoach.wikia.com/wiki/FOSSCoach) event at OSCON.




	
  * Other

	
    * Gerv continued work on a project to calculate what percentage of the world's Internet users have a localized version of Firefox available in their native language.







#### Upcoming events and activities





	
  * The Mozilla Foundation will be a sponsor of the [Personal Democracy Forum conference](http://pdf2008.confabb.com/conferences/60420-personal-democracy-forum-2008) (June 23-24 in New York NY). Brian Behlendorf will be speaking there, and I'm also planning to attend.

	
  * David, Gerv, and Zak will be attending OSCON (July 21-25 in Portland OR) and the Firefox Summit (July 29-31 in Whistler BC). I will be attending the Firefox Summit but not OSCON.
