They say America is suffering a crisis of ill-maintained infrastructure prone to occasional failure. Closer to home I've been having my own infrastructure problems, culminating last week in shoulder surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff. I'll be taking some time out from blogging to invest in healing, physical therapy, and (I hope) eventual recovery. I'm sorry I'll miss the memorial service on June 4 for Dennis Lane, and probably also the reception for Tom Coale on the 18th. In the meantime best wishes to my readers and fellow HoCo bloggers; I hope to see you online or off-line as soon as I can.
