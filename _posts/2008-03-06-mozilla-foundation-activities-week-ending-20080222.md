This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozillafoundation.org/) for the week ending February 22, 2008.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I gave final approval to requests from [Go Daddy](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#Go%20Daddy) (bugs [403437](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=403437) and [418958](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=418958)), [QuoVadis](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#QuoVadis) (bugs [403665](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=403665) and [418701](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=418701)),  and [Trustwave](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#Trustwave) (bugs [409837](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=409837), [409838](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=409838), [409840](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=409840), [418907](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=418907), [418910](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=418910), and [418902](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=418902)) to have their roots EV-enabled (or new EV-capable roots added, the case of Trustwave).

	
    * I also did work on the application from [VeriSign](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#VeriSign) (bug [402947](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=402947)).




	
  * Donations

	
    * David did a [blog post](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2008/02/22/update-on-the-mozilla-foundations-directed-giving-program/) on the status of the Mozilla Foundation's [directed giving program](http://hecker.org/mozilla/directed-giving).
