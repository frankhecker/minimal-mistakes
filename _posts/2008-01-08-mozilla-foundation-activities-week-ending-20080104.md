This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozillafoundation.org/) for the week ending January 4, 2008.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * I got grant agreements in place for two new grants (to be announced later), finished a grant agreement for one more, and received proposals for more grants.




	
  * Licensing and legal

	
    * I worked with Gerv on a plan to make progress on the proposed [replacement for the CVS contributor form](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=342029), with Gerv contributing drafts of related documents.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I approved the application for inclusion from [TÜRKTRUST](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380635) and filed [bug 410821](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=410821) to have the TÜRKTRUST certificates added to NSS.

A final note: Although 2007 has ended, we're still accepting donations to the Mozilla Foundation through our [directed giving program](http://hecker.org/mozilla/directed-giving). Help support [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/donate/), [Camino](http://www.caminobrowser.org/donate/), [SeaMonkey](http://www.seamonkey-project.org/donate), and the [Mozilla accessibility project](http://www.mozilla.org/access/donate.html), as well as general Foundation activities for the coming year.
