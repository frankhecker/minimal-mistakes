I've written and published a new proposed [high-level strategy for Mozilla-related accessibility efforts](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/Strategy). Note that this is _not_ a detailed roadmap for future work, and _not_ a firm commitment to fund or perform such work. Rather it is intended to provide a context within within which we can make overall decisions about where we should concentrate funding and effort. This is especially important because our resources are very much finite, and we will need to make decisions about what we should do and what we should leave undone or leave to others to do.

This is very much a work in progress, and I'll be revising this over time to reflect changed circumstances and priorities. I've reviewed the document with a number of people involved in Mozilla accessibility efforts, and would be happy to consider further revisions based on public comments.

Finally, note that this document supplements and (to some extent) supercedes my previous posts from 2006 and 2007 on making choice and innovation accessible to all and a [proposed vision and strategy for Mozilla accessibility](http://blog.hecker.org/2007/07/08/proposed-mozilla-accessibility-vision-and-strategy/).
