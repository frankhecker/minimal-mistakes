This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozillafoundation.org/) for the week ending November 23, 2007. Note that this was a short week for those of us in the US due to the Thanksgiving holiday.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * I did a blog post describing [Mozilla Foundation grants and related expenditures in 2007](http://hecker.org/mozilla/foundation-grants-2007).

	
    * David Humphrey pointed us to a press article about [Mozilla
activities in Toronto and at Seneca College](http://www.itworldcanada.com/a/Daily-News/b74764b0-d195-40ba-b43e-94672d88ecb5.html). (Seneca is a Mozilla Foundation grantee.)




	
  * Donations

	
    * I did a blog post on the new [Mozilla Foundation directed giving program](http://hecker.org/mozilla/directed-giving).

	
    * David Boswell published a [FAQ about donating to the Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/donate_faq.html) and a new page describing [Foundation activities](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/activities.html), and coordinated updates to the [main Mozilla Foundation donation page](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/donate.html) and the per-project donation pages for [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/donate/), [Camino](http://caminobrowser.org/donate/), [SeaMonkey](http://www.seamonkey-project.org/donate), and [Mozilla accessibility](http://www.mozilla.org/access/donate.html) to people with disabilities.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I worked on the applications for inclusion from [SwissSign](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=343756) and [TÜRKTRUST](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380635) CAs, [announced my intent to approve TÜRKTRUST's inclusion](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tech.crypto/browse_frm/thread/0f57b697e6599889/eae508e1352f87fc#eae508e1352f87fc), and started a two-week comment period on TÜRKTRUST's application.

    * Gerv helped resolve some licensing-related issues.
