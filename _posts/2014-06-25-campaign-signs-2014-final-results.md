The Maryland 2014 primaries are now over, and it’s time for me to wrap up and name some final winners. I’ve had a busy past few weeks with a dozen posts critiquing more than six dozen signs (plus one car magnet). In case you want to revisit signs in any of the primary races, here’s the complete list of posts (rearranged from the order in which I posted them):





  * Howard County
	
    * [County Executive](/2014/06/24/campaign-signs-2014-howard-county-executive/)

	
    * [Council District 1](/2014/06/23/campaign-signs-2014-howard-county-council-district-1/)

	
    * [Sheriff](/2014/06/06/campaign-signs-2014-howard-county-sheriff/)

	
    * [State’s Attorney](/2014/06/08/campaign-signs-2014-howard-county-states-attorney/)

	
    * [Judge of the Orphans’ Court](/2014/06/14/campaign-signs-2014-howard-county-judge-of-the-orphans-court/)

	
    * [Board of Education](/2014/06/22/campaign-signs-2014-howard-county-board-of-education/)


  * Maryland State Senate
	
    * [District 9](/2014/06/20/campaign-signs-2014-maryland-state-senate-district-9/)

	
    * [Districts 12 and 13](/2014/06/21/campaign-signs-2014-maryland-state-senate-districts-12-and-13/)


  * Maryland House of Delegates
	
    * [District 9A](/2014/06/15/campaign-signs-2014-maryland-house-of-delegates-district-9a/)

	
    * [District 9B](/2014/06/17/campaign-signs-2014-maryland-house-of-delegates-district-9b/)

	
    * [District 12](/2014/06/18/campaign-signs-2014-maryland-house-of-delegates-district-12/)

	
    * [District 13](/2014/06/19/campaign-signs-2014-maryland-house-of-delegates-district-13/)



Note that I’ve updated the Board of Education and House of Delegates District 12 posts to add pictures of signs for Allen Dyer and Eric Ebersole respectively.

I already selected winners (or in some cases, multiple winners) for signs in each race. Now it’s time for me to name winners in some special category, as well as an overall winner for all signs I saw.

[![mirabile-delegate-9a-large](http://hecker.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/mirabile-delegate-9a-large.jpg?w=150)](http://hecker.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/mirabile-delegate-9a-large.jpg)The first category is for the best slogan. As I’ve mentioned previously, I’m not too hot on including campaign slogans on signs, and certainly there were a number of signs in this election where the slogan wasn’t doing much more than taking up space. However on Frank Mirabile’s sign the slogan “Time to Stand Our Ground” is both memorable and does something useful, namely letting the more partisan voters in a party primary know exactly where the candidate, uh, stands.

[![stewart-delegate-12-2014-large](http://hecker.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/stewart-delegate-12-2014-large.jpg?w=150)](http://hecker.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/stewart-delegate-12-2014-large.jpg)After seeing lots of signs I get tired of looking at conventional color schemes, either the American colors red, white, and blue or the Maryland colors red, white, black, and yellow, and I yearn for a change. I thus decided to have a “color my world” category, in which the winner is the large Nick Stewart sign and its orange on blue color scheme.

[![miller-delegate-9a-2014-small-changed](http://hecker.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/miller-delegate-9a-2014-small-changed.jpeg?w=150)](https://hecker.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/miller-delegate-9a-2014-small-changed.jpeg)Some signs I thought were almost but not quite what they could be. In some cases (as, for example, with Ryan Frederic’s sign) I don’t know enough about graphic design to determine how the sign could best be improved. In other cases I thought just a relatively small change would do the trick. Hence we have the “most easily improved” category, with the winner being the small Warren Miller sign once the (in my opinion) superfluous design elements in the upper left and right corners have been removed (as I’ve done here).

[![broccolino-states-attorney-2014-large](http://hecker.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/broccolino-states-attorney-2014-large.jpg?w=150)](http://hecker.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/broccolino-states-attorney-2014-large.jpg)Finally, the moment you’ve all been waiting for (or not, as the case may be): My pick for the best Howard County campaign sign of 2014. Those of you who’ve been reading this entire series will not be surprised at my pick, the large Dario Broccolino sign. This sign made me go “wow” the first time I saw it, and I haven’t seen another sign to top it since then.

With that I’m concluding this series, at least for now. I did collect pictures of signs for the gubernatorial race and the race for Attorney General, but I just ran out of energy to post and critique them; maybe later. Also, if I have time and the inclination I’ll post closer to the general election if there are any new signs that didn’t show up in the primary.

Finally, some thanks: First, thanks to all of you who’ve come to this blog to read these posts; I appreciate your attention, and hope your time was worth it. A further thanks to those of you who stopped to comment, who sent me pictures of signs, or who pointed out where I could find them; I love hearing from readers, and thank you for taking the time to contact me. And last but not at all least, thanks to all the candidates who put themselves out in the public eye and ran for election to public office. As I wrote before, you had to endure people commenting on your public appearances, counting up your Twitter and Facebook followers, and making videos about your direct mail pieces. And thanks to me, not even your signs are safe from criticism. Thank you for bearing it all in good grace, and being willing to serve the citizens of Howard County and Maryland.

This is the end of my one-a-day posts; I now return you to your regular (or I should say in my case, irregular) programming. I’m not sure when I’ll post next, or what I’ll post about, but if you’re interested in what more I might have to say please take a moment to click the “Subscribe via email” button or add my [RSS feed](/feed/) to your newsreader. Till later!
