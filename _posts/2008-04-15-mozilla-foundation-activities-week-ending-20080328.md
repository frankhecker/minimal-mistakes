This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending March 28, 2008. (I'm again trying to catch up on status reports.)


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on that week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).

  * Public communications and related issues

	
    * David did more work on revising the www.mozilla.org site, including helping with a 10th anniversary page and a [proposed new About page](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=231131).
