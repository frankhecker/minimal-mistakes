My last two posts were all about me, so I wanted to switch gears and wish a Happy New Year to all of the local Howard County bloggers and other local media mavens it's been my privilege to read and (in many cases) meet:

To [53 Beers on Tap](http://53beersontap.typepad.com/): May your blog overflow with comments, none of which need to be deleted.

To [Child Psych](http://columbiachildpsychologist.blogspot.com/): May your diagnoses be perceptive and your treatments efficacious.

To [Chris Bachmann](http://www.chrisbachmann.com/): May your servers always stay up, and your center progress.

To [Columbia 2.0](http://columbia2.wordpress.com/): May your town center become vibrant, and your opponents' petitions and lawsuits be rejected.

To [Do I Amuse You](http://morucci.blogspot.com/): May your tweets always be amusing, and your screenplays green-lighted.

To [HoCo Matt](http://hocomatt.blogspot.com/): May you be happy even if you decide not to become HoCo Matt for real.

To [HoCoMoJo](http://www.hocomojo.com/): May your mobs always be flash and your videos very viewed.

To [HoCo Politico](http://hocopolitico.blogspot.com/): May your business be successful, and your village well-planned.

To [HoCo Rising](http://www.hocorising.com/): May you become more than just a blogger.

To [HowChow](http://howchow.blogspot.com/): May you find more delicious treats in unexpected places.

To [Hometown Columbia](http://hometowncolumbia.wordpress.com/): May your media always be social, and your generation generative.

To all the local [Patches](http://www.patch.com/): May your stories be hyper-local and your ventures hyper-successful.

To [Sarah Says](http://umcanijustsay.blogspot.com/): May your CSA deliveries be scrumptious and your sidewalks always paved.

To [Wordbones](http://www.wordbones.com/): May your projects be completed on schedule and your buildings be fully leased.

To other [local bloggers](http://www.hocoblogs.com/) whom I might have inadvertently omitted: Best wishes to you too for the coming year, in both your blogging life and your rest-of-life life.
