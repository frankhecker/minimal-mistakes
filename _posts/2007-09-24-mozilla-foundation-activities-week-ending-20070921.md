This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozillafoundation.org/) for the week ending September 21. I spent a lot of the week handling internal administrivia.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Legal/IP issues

	
    * I'm still waiting on more feedback on the proposed [corporate contributors agreement](http://hecker.org/mozilla/corporate-cla-public-draft).




	
  * Grants and related activities

	
    * Alexander Surkov completed the second milestone on his implementation in Mozilla of the IAccessible2 accessibility API
for Windows (to be used by future versions of Firefox and Firefox-compatible screen readers on Windows). The [IA2ToGecko project page](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/IA2ToGecko) has more information, including links to the relevant bugs.

	
    * Ariel Rios completed the second milestone on his project to implement a new Collection interface for the GNOME AT-SPI
accessibility API (to be used by future versions of Firefox and Firefox-compatible screen readers on Linux). For more information (and to track progress) see [GNOME bug 326516](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=326516).

	
    * Steve Lee completed the final milestone for his project to create a prototype switch-activated on-screen keyboard for
Firefox; he'll be showing this at the [Mozilla accessibility summit](http://live.gnome.org/Boston2007/AccessibilitySummit/Mozilla).




	
  * Web sites

	
    * David continued work on [getting old www.mozilla.org content archived](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?query_format=specific&order=relevance+desc&bug_status=__open__&id=395669).







#### Upcoming activities





	
  * I'm considering attending the [Mozilla accessibility summit](http://live.gnome.org/Boston2007/AccessibilitySummit/Mozilla) on October 5 in Boston.

	
  * I'm also considering attending one or both days of the Seneca College [Free Software and Open Source Symposium](http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2007/) (FSOSS 2007) in Toronto on October 25 and 26.
