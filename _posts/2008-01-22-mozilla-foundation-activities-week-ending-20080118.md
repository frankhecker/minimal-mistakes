This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozillafoundation.org/) for the week ending January 18, 2008.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * I'm happy to announce a major new grant from the Mozilla Foundation to [NV Access](http://www.nvaccess.org/) to support development of the [NVDA](http://www.nvda-project.org/) open source screen reader for Windows; the [NVDA developers blog](http://www.nvda-project.org/blog/?p=12) has all the details.

	
    * Scott Haeger completed the final milestone on his Foundation-funded project to improve rich document browsing in the Orca screen reader for Linux. For more information see the GNOME wiki pages for [Firefox 3.0 ARIA widget support in Orca](http://live.gnome.org/Orca/Firefox/ARIAWidgets), [Firefox 3.0 Live Region support in Orca](http://live.gnome.org/Orca/Firefox/LiveRegions), and [integrating the Collection interface into Orca](http://live.gnome.org/Orca/Collection).

	
    * [Codethink Ltd](http://www.codethink.co.uk/) completed its Foundation-funded study on the feasibility of [migrating the AT-SPI accessibility API to use D-Bus](http://live.gnome.org/GAP/AtSpiDbusInvestigation).

	
    * I got a grant agreement in place for another major new grant to be announced later.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I reviewed the applications from [KISA](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#KISA) and [WISeKey](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#WISeKey), tentatively approved them, and started the two-week public comment periods prior to final approval. For more information see bugs [335197](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=335197) and [371362](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=371362) respectively.




	
  * Other

	
    * Gerv is [recovering well](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/2008/01/biopsy_results.html) from his recent surgery.

	
    * David [moved out to California](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2008/01/11/going-to-california/) (not without [some excitement](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2008/01/18/cutting-it-close/)).

	
    * I completed my migration to Google Apps, as discussed in [my last status report](http://hecker.org/mozilla/foundation-activities-2008-01-11). (However I've postponed my blog migration for a week or two until I have more spare time.)







#### Upcoming trips and events





	
  * I'll be attending (at least part of) the [CSUN](http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf/) conference March 10-15 in Los Angeles CA, and the [Freedom to Connect](http://freedom-to-connect.net/) conference March 31 and April 1 in Silver Spring MD.

	
  * Zak will be speaking at the [Southern California Linux Expo](http://www.socallinuxexpo.org/) February 8-10 in Los Angeles, the [PHP Quebec Conference](http://conf.phpquebec.com/) March 12-14 in Montreal, and other events later in 2008.
