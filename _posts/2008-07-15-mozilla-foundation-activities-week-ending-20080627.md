This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending June 27, 2008. My apologies for the delay in posting this.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on that week; for more information about others' activities please see the status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Mozilla Foundation future
