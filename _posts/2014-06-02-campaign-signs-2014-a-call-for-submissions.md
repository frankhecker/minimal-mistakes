Pity the poor political candidates of Howard County. It’s hard enough running a campaign as it is, but they also have pesky bloggers [grading their performances in public forums](http://spartanconsiderations.blogspot.com/2014/05/the-eighth-inningor-whats-in-name.html), [evaluating their direct mail pieces](http://spartanconsiderations.blogspot.com/2014/05/direct-mail-call_31.html), and [keeping track of their social media activities](http://scottesoftware.wordpress.com/2014/02/16/howard-county-council-district-one-race-february-technology-scorecard/). In an upcoming series of posts I’ll be adding to their woes by rendering aesthetic judgements on their campaign signs. (I [did this once before](/2013/06/23/looking-back-at-2010-howard-county-campaign-signs-part-1/) after the 2010 elections, but now I’ll be doing it in a more timely manner.)

In my travels around Howard County I’ve been photographing campaign signs when and where I could. However I’m still missing signs for several candidates for local races and would like to include them if possible. Here are the candidates for whom I do _not_ have sign photos<del>; note that I have _not_ included candidates who are unopposed in the primary election (like Calvin Ball) or even in the general election (like Mary Kay Sigaty)</del>:

If you happen to see signs for any of these people in your neighborhood and it’s safe for you to stop and take a picture on your smartphone or camera, please feel free to send the picture(s) to me at frank@frankhecker.com; I’ll gladly give you a photo credit if you request it.

UPDATE: I mistakenly had Ellen Flynn Giles as a candidate this year for Board of Education. Thanks to Joan Lancos for setting me straight.

UPDATE 2: I have updated the post to mark cases where I now have pictures of signs. I still do not have signs for the remaining candidates.
