In [a prior post](http://www.swindleeeee.com/2006/07/15/emusic-toolbar-for-firefox-coming/) a while back I talked about how job postings were useful clues to what a company's up to. Well, I found some more eMusic job postings, courtesy of the ever useful [Digital Music News](http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/); there are not many clues to eMusic's future, but it's always interesting to see what's involved in running eMusic. Here are the current positions (warning: as these positions are filled I'd expect the URLs to stop working):



	
  * [Manager of business development](http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/jobs/emusic_bizdev) . This is pretty much a classic "BD" position, responsible for recruiting business partners that can help drive new eMusic business.  The most interesting part is the very first item: "Drive subscriber growth by developing new domestic and global partnerships with OEM hardware, software, video game and mobile companies." This might encompass everything from bundling an eMusic trial subscription with MP3 players (hardware or software) to allowing people to purchase and download tracks from eMusic from their mobile phones or even in a video game environment. Assuming partners can get past the fact that their customers won't be able to get OutKast's latest, the MP3-based DRM-free nature of eMusic's tracks could be a major plus in making it easier to incorporate eMusic-supplied music into their products.

	
  * [Data analyst](http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/jobs/emusic_analyst). Only hard-core statistics nerds need apply for this position. Two key tasks: "analyzing downloading trends and making merchandising recommendations" and "ongoing download price-point analysis." In other words, figure out what's selling and how to sell more of it, all within the context of eMusic's (somewhat complicated) pricing models. Also on this person's plate: "Work with Marketing to analyze and implement acquisition and retention test plans." In other words, how can eMusic attract more subscribers and keep the ones it has?

	
  * [Senior licensing coordinator](http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/jobs/emusic_license). This is an unsexy position but one that's very critical to eMusic's business. Key task: "manage the day to day administration tasks of eMusic licensing", basically ensuring that all the legal niceties are satisfied and data generated to enable everyone to get paid who needs to be paid. A whole blog post (or more) could be devoted to the byzantine world of music licensing, where the relevant rights (and hence the necessary licenses) are split among multiple players. For a taste of the complexities involved, check out the [FAQ](http://www.harryfox.com/public/FAQ.jsp) produced by the [Harry Fox Agency](http://www.harryfox.com/), one of the main licensing players; for information specifically about "digital permanent download" (DPD) licenses see the [digital license FAQ](http://www.harryfox.com/public/infoFAQDigitalLicensing.jsp).

	
  * [Creative Director](http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/jobs/emusic_creative). Key task: "own and develop the growth of the eMusic Visual Brand". I put this position last because it doesn't have much to do with the unique nature of eMusic's business; it's just the same sort of position you'd find at any company doing brand-based marketing. Maybe the result will be a nicer eMusic logo, a better-looking web site, and more attractive ads, but I doubt any of these are truly key to eMusic's core business.


That's all for now; when I have time I'll try to find some more eMusic job postings in other places...
