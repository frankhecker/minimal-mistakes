I love that people at eMusic are posting at [17 dots](http://www.17dots.com/); as I [mentioned](http://swindleeeee.com/2007/03/04/what-is-emusics-free-prize/) previously, it's integrating eMusic itself into the eMusic user community. But... I do almost all my blog reading using a feed reader (NetNewsWire in my case), and it's driving me up a wall that 17 dots doesn't have a full text feed. Given the rate that they're posting at, there are a lots of posts to read,  and it really interrupts my flow when I see something I find interesting only to be stopped by the inevitable (moreâ€¦).

This practice is not unique to 17 dots, of course. [Bob Lefsetz](http://www.lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php) does this too, and the excerpts in his feed are often even more abbreviated. I can sort of see why Lefsetz is doing this; presumably among other things he wants people to come to his web site and subscribe to his email newsletter. But what's the reasoning behind 17 dots not offering a full feed? There's no pitch on the web site itself; the post pages don't have ads for eMusic or even a link to eMusic. So why deny us our God-given right never to leave our feed reader?

P.S. I noticed that James Governor (of [Redmonk](http://www.redmonk.com/) fame) also [complained about this](http://17dots.com/2007/04/18/418-older-arrivals/).
