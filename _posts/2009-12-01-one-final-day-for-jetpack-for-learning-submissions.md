We received a lot of submissions for the [Jetpack for Learning Design Challenge](http://design-challenge.mozilla.org/jetpack-for-learning/) just prior to [last night's deadline](http://blog.hecker.org/2009/11/25/jetpack-for-learning-deadline-extended/). In order to accomodate last-minute entries, we've decided to further extend the deadline through midnight (US Pacific time) tonight, Tuesday, December 1. There will be no further extensions.

We've received a lot of good submissions thus far, and the Jetpack for Learning team is hard at work preparing for the next phase of the challenge.
