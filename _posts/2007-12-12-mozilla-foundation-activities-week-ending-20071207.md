This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozillafoundation.org/) for the week ending December 7, 2007.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * Ariel Rios completed his Foundation-funded project to add the Accessibility::Collection interface to the AT-SPI accessibility API for GNOME; for more information see [GNOME bug 326516](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=326516).

	
    * Patrick Michaud produced a [progress report](http://use.perl.org/~pmichaud/journal/35049) on the Perl 6 work jointly funded by the Mozilla Foundation and the Perl Foundation.

	
    * Zak and I worked on some new grant proposals.




	
  * Licensing and legal

	
    * Gerv worked on revising and updating the [Mozilla license policy](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/license-policy.html), to bring the document in line with current practice.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I approved the application for inclusion from [SwissSign](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=343756) and filed [bug 407396](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=407396) to have the SwissSign CA certificates added to NSS.

    * David Boswell worked on various changes to www.mozilla.org, including a new [Mozilla Foundation home page](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) and a new Featured Projects page ([bug 393447](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=393447)).




	
  * Miscellaneous
