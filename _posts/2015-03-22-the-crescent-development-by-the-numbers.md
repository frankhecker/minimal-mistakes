_tl;dr: The Crescent development in downtown Columbia is going to be a (very) big deal._

As [reported by Amanda Yeager in the Baltimore
Sun](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/columbia/ph-crescent-property-planning-board-story.html),
the Howard County Planning Board recently approved FDP-DC-Crescent-1,
the final development plan for phase 1 of the Crescent neighborhood of
downtown Columbia, a development of the [Howard Hughes
Corporation](http://howardhughes.com/). Unfortunately due to family
issues I was not able to attend the Planning Board meeting and see for
myself the presentations of the plan. However I did find and review
copies of the [Department of Planning and Zoning staff
report](http://www.howardcountymd.gov/WorkArea/linkit.aspx?LinkIdentifier=id&ItemID=6442478703&libID=6442478696)
[PDF], [the final development plan
itself](http://www.co.ho.md.us/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6442478431)
[PDF], and the accompanying [neighborhood concept
plan](www.co.ho.md.us/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6442478432)
[PDF]. For anyone interested I here briefly review what’s going on
with the development. (For additional background see my post from a
year ago, “[The Crescent development in downtown Columbia: Areas and
phases]({{ site.url }}/2014/04/06/the-crescent-development-in-downtown-columbia-areas-and-phases/)”,
although a lot of the information in that post is now out of date.)

In Howard County planning terminology a “final development plan” is
not really the final plan; that role is filled by the “site
development plan”. The final development plan contains proposed
boundaries for phase 1 of the Crescent development, intended uses for
the various parcels and associated square footages and building
heights, and other information relevant to the plan. It does _not_
contain detailed plans of the actual buildings to be built. However
just the raw numbers themselves are interesting and informative. To
quote the Baltimore Sun,

> The approved outline proposes 2,300 residences; a 250-room hotel;
> 1.475 million square feet of office space; 313,000 square feet of
> retail and 225,000 square feet of civic and cultural uses spread
> throughout four development areas on the property.

The four development areas are known (rather unimaginatively) as Areas
1, 2, 3, and 4, with locations and proposed uses as follows:

* Area 1 includes Parcels A and B on the map shown, in the northwest
  corner of the Crescent development near the intersection of Broken
  Land Parkway and Little Patuxent Parkway. It is intended for office
  use along with a hotel, with some retail and restaurant space.
* Area 2 includes Parcel C on the map, south of Area 1 on the east
  side of Broken Land Parkway. It is intended for mixed office and
  residential uses, with some retail and restaurant space.
* Area 3 includes Parcel D on the map, south of Merriweather Post
  Pavilion and north of Broken Land Parkway. It is intended as the
  main “downtown” of the Crescent development, with office and
  residential uses, a much larger allotment of retail and restaurant
  space, and cultural and community facilities.
* Area 4 includes Parcel E on the map, east of Area 1 just south of
  Little Patuxent Parkway. It is intended primarily for office use,
  with a small amount of retail and restaurant space.

There is also a significant amount of space that will be left
undeveloped , including Lots 1, 2, and 3 on the map shown. These will
serve as natural open space for the project, and can be considered
extensions of the western and southern portions of Symphony Woods.

The table below summarizes all of the uses proposed for Areas 1
through 4, including the associated square footage and related details
(from page 1 of FDP-DC-Crescent-1).

The final development plan does not describe the exact nature of the
225,000 SF of “Cultural/Community” space in Area 3. However in the
pre-submission meeting Howard Hughes representatives discussed
building in Area 3 a new Central Branch library (100,000 SF), a
conference center (50,000 SF), an aquatic center (50,000 SF), and an
indoor concert hall (25,000 SF).

In the pre-submission meeting Howard Hughes representatives also
discussed locating all 2,300 residential units in Area 3 along with
the 250-room hotel; no office space was planned for Area 3. The final
development plan moves the hotel from Area 3 into Area 1, moves 500
residential units from Area 3 to Area 2, and puts 400,000 SF of office
space into Area 3.

One major omission in the final development plan (really, _the_ major
omission) is a detailed discussion of parking. The slides presented in
the pre-submission meeting contained detailed information on the
number of parking spaces to be provided in each area through either
surface parking lots or parking garages (which would eventually
replace all the surface lots). None of that is in the final
development plan. Apparently the exact parking arrangements will be
covered in the site development plans to be submitted for each area,
including proposals for how to compensate for the loss of the current
gravel lots used for events at Merriweather Post Pavilion.

Overall the Crescent development will make a major impact on downtown
Columbia and Howard County overall. One good comparison is to look at
Reston, Virginia, the other major planned community in the
Washington/Baltimore area, and Reston Town Center, which is currently
[undergoing its final commercial
buildout](http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2014/06/high-five-for-boston-properties-latest-reston-town.html)
within its 84-acre core. Based on the figures in the [Reston Town
Center marketing
brochure](http://www.cbre.us/o/tysonscorner/AssetLibrary/RestonTownCenterFlyer.pdf)
[PDF] published by its developer, here’s how Reston Town Center
compares to the planned Crescent neighborhood:

When you factor in the office space just north of Little Patuxent
Parkway (including [700,000 SF purchased by Howard Hughes Corporation
from
GGP](http://www.bizjournals.com/baltimore/blog/real-estate/2014/12/howard-hughes-corp-makes-130m-purchase-in-columbia.html?page=all))
the downtown Columbia area will have roughly equivalent office space
to Reston Town Center. When you add in the [1.438 million SF of
leasable space at the Mall in
Columbia](http://www.ggp.com/properties/mall-properties/the-mall-in-columbia)
the retail space will be significantly larger than in Reston Town
Center. Finally, Reston Town Center has no equivalent to Merriweather
Post Pavilion (or, for that matter, to the planned Merriweather Park
at Symphony Woods). (However Reston Town Center does now have access
to mass transit via the Metro Silver Line, as well as a much more
vibrant office market in the surrounding area.)

As I noted in [discussing the history of Howard County Council
redistricting]({{ site.url }}/2010/12/02/a-history-of-howard-county-council-redistricting-part-4/),
on the tenth anniversary of Columbia former county commissioner and
council member Charles Miller expressed regret that Columbia had ever
been created. Now as Columbia approaches its 50th anniversary, current
County Executive Allan Kittleman has promised that he will work to
“[attract] large businesses to downtown Columbia so it may truly
become the economic engine for our County”. The Crescent development
will be the key to making that happen.
