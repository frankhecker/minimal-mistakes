This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozillafoundation.org/) for the week ending October 19. I spent almost all of my time working on internal projects and projects not yet ready for public announcement; some of these will be announced soon.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Legal/IP issues

	
    * I'm still waiting on more feedback on the proposed [corporate contributors agreement](http://hecker.org/mozilla/corporate-cla-public-draft).







#### Upcoming activities





	
  * I'll attending the Seneca College [Free Software and Open Source Symposium](http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2007/) (FSOSS 2007) in Toronto on October 25 and 26 (although due to my flight schedule I'll miss most of the talks on the 25th).
