For those Mozilla folks and others who've been following my [full blog feed](http://blog.hecker.org/feed/): I happen to live in [Howard County, Maryland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_County,_Maryland), between Washington DC and Baltimore.For a while now I've been following [Howard County local bloggers](http://www.hocoblogs.com/) but haven't joined the conversation myself. I've now been prompted to write on at least one Howard County topic, and in the event I write more I've started a [Howard County category](http://blog.hecker.org/category/howardcounty/) for my blog and a corresponding feed. If you're not interested in this stuff I suggest you consider resubscribing to just my [Mozilla feed](http://blog.hecker.org/feed/mozilla/).
