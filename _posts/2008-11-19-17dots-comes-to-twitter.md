(In the spirit of Twitter, I'll keep this post brief.)

eMusic folks are now twittering as [@17dots](http://twitter.com/17dots) (but folks, register @emusic too before it's taken)

@17dots following more (94) than follow it (61), should promote on the message boards

Suggest @17dots do 1-3 posts per day, highlight new arrivals, always include links

@17dots "competition": @amazonmp3 daily deals, 6,849 followers (OK but drop in bucket, Twitter over-hyped?)
