For [today's instance](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/StatusMeetings/2009-06-15) of our [weekly Mozilla Education call](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/StatusMeetings) at 11 am EDT / 8 am PDT / 1500 UTC we'll be talking about a proposed multi-disciplinary multi-school meta-project to move the [Processing programming language](http://processing.org/) to the open web. (Processing is currently Java-based, though there is a [JavaScript port](http://processingjs.org/) in progress).

I'll also be glad to answer any questions people might have about the [SoftHum workshop](http://edudev.hfoss.org/index.php/SoftHumWorkshop) that I attended last week and [blogged about](http://blog.hecker.org/2009/06/14/the-softhum-workshop-on-teaching-open-source/).
