This doesn't sound good: While researching a Howard County-related blog post today I happened to follow a Google search to [www.columbia-md.com](http://www.columbia-md.com/) (a [domain controlled by General Growth Partners](http://www.whois.net/whois_new.cgi?d=columbia-md&tld=com)), and got the following [message](http://whm.maiatech.com/suspended.page/): This Account Is No Longer Active.

I guess when [your stock's in the toilet and you're flirting with bankruptcy](http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-tue_general-growthnov11,0,4160199.story) you've got more pressing things to worry about than keeping your web sites up.
