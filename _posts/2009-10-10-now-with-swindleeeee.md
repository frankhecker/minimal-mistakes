It was over six years ago that I first subscribed to the [eMusic](http://www.emusic.com/) digital music service, and over three years since I started my blog [Swindleeeee!!!!!](http://swindleeeee.com/) to provide an outlet for my eMusic-related musings. My posting frequency (never that high) has in recent months fallen off drastically. I either don't have anything I want to write about eMusic, or I don't have time to write anything.

Rather than have Swindleeeee!!!!! join the millions of other blogs that have dribbled off into nothingness, I've decided to give it a dignified exit. More specifically:




  * I've moved all my old Swindleeeee!!!!! posts over to [this blog](http://blog.hecker.org/) under the [music category](http://blog.hecker.org/category/music/), in case you ever have occasion to read them or link to them.


  * If you subscribed to Swindleeeee!!!!! using a newsfeed reader (e.g., [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/), [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/), etc.) and you want to see my future posts on similar topics, please subscribe to my music-related posts on this blog using the new feed URL `[http://blog.hecker.org/category/music/feed/](http://blog.hecker.org/category/music/feed/)`.


  * <del>As time permits I will redirect</del> I've redirected all permalinks for the old Swindleeeee!!!!! site to the corresponding posts on this blog, so that the old URLs will still work for anyone who's referenced them in a blog post or other context.


Thanks to all of you who read and commented on Swindleeeee!!!!! posts. Please continue reading this blog if you're interested in what I might have to say on eMusic and the music industry.
