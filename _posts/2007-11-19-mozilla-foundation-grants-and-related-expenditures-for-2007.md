I previously posted some information on the [Mozilla Foundation's grants and related expenditures in 2006](http://blog.hecker.org/2007/10/23/mozilla-foundation-grants-and-related-expenditures-for-2006/). Since then I've been expanding our internal database of information about such expenditures, and have now gotten to the point where I can provide the same information for 2007. <del>I'll continue updating this post in the remainder of the year as we add new projects.</del>


#### Background


In my [previous post](http://blog.hecker.org/2007/10/23/mozilla-foundation-grants-and-related-expenditures-for-2006/) I provided information important to understanding the Mozilla Foundation's grant and grant-related activities. See the post for the full details; here's a brief recap of the two most important points:



	
  * There's a difference between what we consider to be grants (made to US-based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organizations or non-US equivalents as part of a formal grant agreement) and related expenditures (contracts with individuals or organizations to perform certain work, or travel sponsorship of individuals). This post covers both categories.

	
  * There's a difference between the Mozilla Foundation's activities and the [community program](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Community:CommunityProgram) (sometimes referred to as community giving) run by the Mozilla Corporation. This post covers only Foundation expenditures.


For more on the history behind the Mozilla Foundation's grants and related activities, see my [original blog post](http://hecker.org/mozilla/foundation-grants) from July 2006.


#### Grants and related expenditures in 2007


Now to the details on items we funded in 2007<del> to date</del>. We made the following expenditures that we consider to be grants as defined above, with grantees as noted:



	
  * Support and maintenance of the [mozdev.org](http://www.mozdev.org/) site ([Mozdev Community Organization](http://www.mozdev.org/about.html), $30,000). This is a follow-up to a similar grant made in 2006; for more information on activities funded under this grant see [Doug Warner's blog](http://www.silfreed.net/taxonomy/term/5/0).

	
  * Development of [Perl 6](http://dev.perl.org/perl6/) and [Parrot](http://www.parrotcode.org/) ([The Perl Foundation](http://www.perlfoundation.org/), $10,000). For more information see the [grant announcement](http://www.perlfoundation.org/patrick_michaud_awarded_perl_6_development_grant_as_a_joint_initiative_by_the_perl_foundation_and_mozilla_foundation).

	
  * Implementation of accessibility features in the [Dojo](http://dojotoolkit.org/) AJAX toolkit (University of Toronto [Adaptive Technology Resource Centre](http://atrc.utoronto.ca/), $70,000). For more information see David Bolter's [final report](http://david.atrc.utoronto.ca/mozgrant/dojo-final-report.html) on this project.

	
  * Research into enabling commodity webcams to be used as simple switch input devices (e.g., by tracking users' head or hand movements), for example in conjunction with software like [Jambu](http://www.oatsoft.org/trac/jambu) ([University of North Carolina](http://www.cs.unc.edu/), $10,000). For more information see Gary Bishop's [blog post on CamKey](http://wwwx.cs.unc.edu/~gb/wp/blog/2007/11/18/camkeys-is-a-simple-camera-based-alternative-keyboard/).

	
  * Enhancement of the [NVDA](http://www.nvda-project.org/) open source screen reader for Windows to better support rich web documents accessed through Firefox ([NV Access](http://www.nvaccess.org/), approx. $90,000). For more information see the [NVDA blog](http://www.nvda-project.org/blog/).

	
  * Ongoing support of Creative Commons and its work to help build a participatory web by promoting creation and sharing of content (in conjunction with several other funders) ([Creative Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org/), $100,000). For more information see the [Creative Commons press release](to help build a participatory Web by making it easy to share as well as protect one’s creative work.).

	
  * Mozilla-related educational activities ([Seneca College](http://www.senecac.on.ca/), $100,000). For more information see the [Seneca press release](http://www.senecac.on.ca/cms/media/newsdetail.jsp?mediaID=136). For ongoing information about Seneca's Mozilla-related activities, see [David Humphrey’s blog](http://vocamus.net/dave/), as well as my [blog post](http://hecker.org/mozilla/seneca-college-and-open-source-education) discussing the strategic importance of what Seneca is doing.

	
  * Support of GNOME accessibility and other GNOME activities ([GNOME Foundation](http://foundation.gnome.org/), $10,000). For more information see the [GNOME Foundation announcement](http://www.gnome.org/press/releases/2008-03-mofojoins.html).

	
  * Support of FSF activities related to [coreboot](http://www.coreboot.org/Welcome_to_coreboot) (formerly LinuxBIOS) ([Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/), $10,000).


(Note that some of our conference sponsorships were done as grants as well; however for simplicity I've included those with the other conference-related expenditures listed below.)

The next category covers software development and related activities, mostly through contracts with individuals:

	
  * Produce a Java-based conforming [HTML5](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current work/) parser that implements error reporting as needed by the [HTML5 conformance checker](http://about.validator.nu/), and an HTML5 parser library for Java applications as a drop-in replacement for XML parsers ([Henri Sivonen](http://hsivonen.iki.fi/)). For more information see the [Validator.nu HTML parser project page](http://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/).

	
  * Enhance the [OpenSSL](http://www.openssl.org/) cryptographic library and Apache [mod_ssl](http://www.modssl.org/) SSL/TLS module to support sending of OCSP responses to Firefox and other web browsers as part of the SSL/TLS protocol exchange ([Open Source Software Institute](http://www.oss-institute.org/)). For more information see the [OpenSSL code changes](http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=16617) and [Apache bug 43822](http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=43822).

	
  * Improve scriptability in Camino and provide a new way to extend the browser using AppleScript ([Peter Jaros](http://peeja.com/)). (Note that this project was a proposed Summer of Code project that ended up being co-funded by the Mozilla Foundation and the Camino project instead.) For more information see the [original proposal](http://wiki.caminobrowser.org/Development:Summer_of_Code_2007:AppleScript:Proposal) and the [associated bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&short_desc_type=substring&short_desc=%5BSoC%5D&emailassigned_to1=1&emailtype1=exact&email1=peter.a.jaros%40gmail.com&chfieldto=Now&cmdtype=doit).

	
  * Implement the [IAccessible2](http://www.linux-foundation.org/en/Accessibility/IAccessible2) accessibility API for Windows in Mozilla (Alexander Surkov). For more information see the [IA2ToGecko](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/IA2ToGecko) page.

	
  * Create a Firefox extension to simulate the appearance of web pages to someone with colorblindness (Jörg Dotzki). For more information see the [colorblind simulator project page](http://live.gnome.org/GAP/ColorBlind).

	
  * Implement techniques for improved keyboard navigation to active elements on a web page (Leo Spalteholz). This was another proposed Summer of Code project for which we didn't have a slot, and subsequently decided to fund ourselves.

	
  * Complete implementation of the [Accerciser](http://live.gnome.org/Accerciser) interactive test tool for testing Firefox and other applications supporting the AT-SPI accessibility API on Linux and the GNOME desktop ([Eitan Isaacson](http://www.monotonous.org/)). For more information see the associated [GNOME Journal article](http://www.gnomejournal.org/article/56/exercising-your-application-with-accerciser).

	
  * Optimizing Firefox for pointer and switch access ([Steve Lee](http://elgg.net/stevelee/)). (Note that 2007 funding was a continuation of previous funding made in 2006.) This project addresses accessibility for people with physical dexterity or mobility problems (as opposed to much accessibility work, which relates to blind users); for more information see the [Jambu](http://www.oatsoft.org/trac/jambu) project page.

	
  * Enhance the [Fire Vox](http://firevox.clcworld.net/) screen reader extension for Firefox to support [WAI ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) widgets, and thus become the first assistive technology to fully support ARIA with Firefox ([Charles Chen](http://www.clcworld.net/about.html)).  For more information see the [WIA AIRA live regions page](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/AJAX:WAI_ARIA_Live_Regions) on the [Mozilla Developer Center site](http://developer.mozilla.org/).

	
  * Complete the implementation of the Collection interface for GNOME's [Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT-SPI) (AT-SPI) to provide performance and functionality improvements to support Firefox accessibility on Linux (Ariel Rios). For more information see [GNOME bug 326516](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=326516).

	
  * Enhance the [Orca](http://live.gnome.org/Orca) open source screen reader for Linux to support Firefox, including the ability to navigate using web page elements and initial support for [ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria) (landmarks only) (Scott Haeger). For more information see the [dependency tree for GNOME bug 423348](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=423348).

	
  * Migrate [Orca](http://live.gnome.org/Orca) to use [pyatspi](http://live.gnome.org/GAP/PythonATSPI), a new standard Python client library for the GNOME [AT-SPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT-SPI) accessibility interface ([Eitan Isaacson](http://www.monotonous.org/)). For more information see [Eitan Isaacson's blog post](http://monotonous.org/?p=31).

	
  * Implement various enhancements to [Orca](http://live.gnome.org/Orca) as used with Firefox, including performance enhancements and bug fixes ([Eitan Isaacson](http://www.monotonous.org/)). For more information see GNOME bugs [448848](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=448848), [446277](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=446277), and [491862](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=491862), as well as the blog post referenced in the last item.

	
  * Enhance [Orca](http://live.gnome.org/Orca) to improve the quality of [Braille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille) output to match those of proprietary screen readers (including support of [contracted Braille](http://www.afb.org/braillebug/braille_deciphering.asp), also known as Grade 2 Braille) ([Eitan Isaacson](http://www.monotonous.org/)).

	
  * Evaluate the feasibility of porting the GNOME [AT-SPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT-SPI) accessibility interface from [ORBit](http://www.gnome.org/projects/ORBit2/) to [D-Bus](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus), in order to ensure that the accessibility infrastructure used by Firefox on Linux is as up to date as possible ([Codethink Ltd](http://www.codethink.co.uk/)). For more information see the [associated project page](http://live.gnome.org/GAP/AtSpiDbusInvestigation).


The final category comprises conferences and other events for which the Mozilla Foundation either provided sponsorship or paid travel and related costs for Mozilla contributors, or both:

	
  * [CSUN 2007](http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf/2007/genconfinfo07.htm). We had a Mozilla booth at this major accessibility conference in Los Angeles in March 2007, and sponsored travel costs for a number of attendees; for more information see the [Mozilla CSUN 2007](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Accessibility/csun2007) wiki page and David Bolter's [CSUNzilla](http://mindforks.blogspot.com/2007/03/csunzilla-part-2-impressions.html) blog post.

	
  * [W4A workshop](http://www.w4a.info/2007/). We sponsored some attendees to this accessibility workshop in Banff in May 2007. We subsequently became an official sponsor of the [2008 W4A meeting](http://www.w4a.info/2008/) as well.

	
  * [Internet as a Public Good Symposium](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/ipg/Main_Page). We co-sponsored this event in Boston July 30-31, along with Harvard University.

	
  * [Mozilla accessibility summit 2007](http://live.gnome.org/Boston2007/AccessibilitySummit/Mozilla). We sponsored a few people to attend this meeting of Mozilla accessibility developers in Boston in October 2007. (Note that the bulk of the support for this meeting came from the Mozilla Corporation.)

	
  * [SS12 accessibility code-a-thon](http://ss12.info/). We were a sponsor of this event held November 17 and 18, 2007, at the [University of Southern California](http://www.usc.edu/), working in conjunction with [Project:Possibility](http://www.projectpossibility.org/) and [Knowbility](http://www.knowbility.org/).

	
  * [Foundations of Open Media Software 2008](http://www.annodex.org/events/foms2008/). We're a sponsor of this developer workshop to be held January 24 and 25, 2008, in
Melbourne.

	
  * Sponsorship of a 2008 event put on by the [American Association of People with Disabilities](http://www.aapd-dc.org/).

	
  * Sponsorship of three accessibility-related conferences and other events to be held in 2008 by [Knowbility](http://www.knowbility.org/).




#### Summary


Between the three categories of expenditures above (grants, contracts for development, and conference and travel sponsorship) <del>we've approved funding of approximately half a million dollars thus far in 2007</del> we approved funding of over $700K in 2007. <del>Note that these are not final numbers, and may differ somewhat from the numbers actually reported for 2007 in our filings next year in 2008. (In particular, not all the money authorized has yet been spent, and may not be spent in 2007 because some contracts are still in progress and payments are contingent on additional milestones being completed.)</del> Note that these numbers may differ somewhat from the numbers actually reported for 2007 in our filings, because not all the grants and related expenditures approved in 2007 were actually paid in 2007.

In general we've continued the trends started in 2006, including an emphasis on funding accessibility-related projects (which accounted for almost three quarters of all expenditures). <del>It's too early to tell how much we'll spend in total in 2007 on grants and related expenditures, but we'll quite possibly double the amount spent in 2006. (As noted above, I'll update this report as appropriate.)</del> In 2007 we more than doubled the amount spent in 2006. As we move into 2008 we'll be funding projects in more areas as well.
