This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending June 6, 2008.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * Alexander Surkov completed the intermediate milestone on his Mozilla Foundation-funded project to develop automated tests and regression fixes in the Mozilla accessibility module; so far he's fixed 16 outstanding bugs (relating to crashes, regressions, and new features), as well as kept the [accessibility API documentation](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Accessibility:AT-APIs) up to date and worked on several other accessibility-related tasks.

	
    * [Proceedings](http://www.foms-workshop.org/foms2008/pmwiki.php/Main/Proceedings), [slides](http://www.annodex.org/events/lca2008_mmm/uploads/foms_summary.pdf), and an [attendee list](http://www.foms-workshop.org/foms2008/pmwiki.php/Main/AttendeeList) have now been published for the [Foundations of Open Media Software 2008 workshop](http://www.foms-workshop.org/foms2008/), for which the Mozilla Foundation was a sponsor.




	
  * Legal issues

	
    * I approved a new [privacy policy for mozilla.org sites](http://www.mozilla.org/privacy-policy.html) and David Boswell posted it to www.mozilla.org. (Note that this is a separate policy from the [privacy policy for mozilla.com sites](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/privacy-policy.html), although it is based on that policy.)




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * Gerv [proposed some ideas](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.security/browse_thread/thread/b2cda44a0e6c4d5c#) as to how we might address the [Debian weak key problem](http://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys) in a Mozilla context.

	
    * Kathleen Wilson is waiting on responses from CAs to close out her information-gathering work on their requests. I worked with her to identify a set of new requests to look at, including those for Trustis (bug [324126](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=324126)), Microsec Ltd (bug [370505](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=370505)), S-TRUST (bug [370627](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=370627)), and TC TrustCenter (bug [378882](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=378882)).

	
    * I put [Entrust](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#Entrust)'s request to enable the Entrust Root Certification Authority for EV (bug [416544](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=416544)) into the [first public comment period](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tech.crypto/browse_thread/thread/8ae9fe7c28ec563d#).




	
  * Public communication

	
    * David Boswell continued work on a new www.mozilla.org design brief.

	
    * David worked to help produce a new draft of the proposed [Mozilla brochure](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/creating-a-mozilla-brochure/) and get model release forms signed for people whose photos appear in the brochure.




	
  * Conferences

	
    * Zak Greant continued work on the proposed [FOSSCoach](http://fosscoach.wikia.com/wiki/FOSSCoach) event at OSCON.




	
  * Other

	
    * Gerv Markham worked on a project to calculate what percentage of the world's Internet users have a localized version of Firefox available in their native language.

	
    * Gerv also worked on a project to compile a definitive domain suffix list, e.g., suffixes like "co.uk" that do not themselves refer to web sites (unlike, e.g., "co.org"); this list could be useful in contexts like handling of cookies, bookmarks, etc.







#### Upcoming events and activities





	
  * The Mozilla Foundation will be a sponsor of the [Personal Democracy Forum conference](http://pdf2008.confabb.com/conferences/60420-personal-democracy-forum-2008) (June 23-24 in New York NY). Brian Behlendorf will be speaking there, and I'm also planning to attend.

	
  * David, Gerv, and Zak will be attending OSCON (July 21-25 in Portland OR) and the Firefox Summit (July 29-31 in Whistler BC). I will be attending the Firefox Summit but not OSCON.
