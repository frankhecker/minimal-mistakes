This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozillafoundation.org/) for the week ending October 12. Last week we had a Foundation board meeting, and we're working on some internal (for now) initiatives coming out of that.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Legal/IP issues

	
    * I've been responding to queries sent to licensing@mozilla.org.

	
    * I'm still waiting on more feedback on the proposed [corporate contributors agreement](http://hecker.org/mozilla/corporate-cla-public-draft).




	
  * Grants and related activities

	
    * Steve Lee posted a [report on the current status of the Jambu project](http://eduspaces.net/stevelee/weblog/202223.html) being funded by the Foundation.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I'm taking over CA-related tasks from Gerv Markham, and am now the default assignee on CA-related bugs.

	
    * I filed [bug 399214](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=399214) to start work on updating the [Mozilla CA Certificate Policy](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/policy/) to address [Extended Validation (EV) certificates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate). (See also the [discussion in m.d.t.crypto](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tech.crypto/browse_frm/thread/6117beabe53da5df/e367242dadceae81).)




	
  * Other

	
    * Zak Greant attended and represented the Foundation at the[ OpenMind 2007 and MindTrek 2007 conferences](http://zak.greant.com/conference-report-openmind-mindtrek-2007/).

	
    * David Boswell attended the [Legal Summit for Software Freedom](http://www.softwarefreedom.org/summit/2007/).







#### Upcoming activities





	
  * I'll be in Washington DC Friday evening October 19 to attend a[ G3Ict](http://www.g3ict.com) event.

	
  * I'll attending the Seneca College [Free Software and Open Source Symposium](http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2007/) (FSOSS 2007) in Toronto on October 25 and 26 (although due to my flight schedule I'll miss most of the talks on the 25th).




#### Random notes


Some of you may recall the [Mozilla Digital Memory Bank](http://mozillamemory.org/) project being run by the [Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu/) (CHNM) at[ George Mason University](http://www.gmu.edu/); among other things they've published a[ series of interviews](http://mozillamemory.org/blog/) with various members of the Mozilla project. More recently the Firefox extension [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) created by CHNM was included in the [Firefox Campus Edition](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/add-ons/campus/).

When the Mozilla Digital Memory Bank project was just starting I had the pleasure of meeting with a number of people at CHNM, including its founder and director, Roy Rosenzweig. I was therefore saddened to read this weekend in the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101202489.html) that Dr. Rosenzweig had died last Thursday. Please join me in expressing condolences to Dr. Rosenzweig's family and the staff at CHNM.
