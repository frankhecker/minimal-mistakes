This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozillafoundation.org/) for the week ending January 25, 2008.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I reviewed the applications from [QuoVadis](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#QuoVadis), [Digicert](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#Digicert), and [Trustwave](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#Trustwave), tentatively approved them, and started the public comment periods prior to final approval.
