This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozillafoundation.org/) for the week ending February 15, 2008.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * Still waiting on formal grant announcements. (Yes, I know, this is getting old.)




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I worked on CA applications from [Cisco](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#Cisco), [S-TRUST](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#S-TRUST), and [WISeKey](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#WISeKey).

	
    * I gave final approval for Digicert to have its root enabled for EV (bugs [403644](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=403644) and [416827](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=416827)).

    * I worked on arrangements for [CSUN](http://www.csun.edu/cod/conf/) and (with Marco Zehe) for [SightCity](http://www.sightcity.net/).
