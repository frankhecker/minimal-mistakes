I've been meaning to post this for a while, so here it is: If for some odd reason you want to read more from me than my occasional blog posts, note that I do maintain a microblog (or tumblr, as the cognoscenti call it, after the underlying [service](http://www.tumblr.com/about)) at [hecker.tumblr.com](http://hecker.tumblr.com/) where I record short thoughts, including links to articles I thought interesting. Some if not all of these posts I could publish on my main blog, but I tend to reserve that blog for longer posts with more analysis and background research. Posting to the tumblr is quick and easy, and so I don't feel the need to justify time spent in posting in the same way as I do on my WordPress.com blog.
