For those of you participating (or interested in participating) in our [weekly Mozilla Education teleconference calls](http://education.mozilla.org/StatusMeetings), here's what to expect the next few weeks:

First, for this week's call Philipp Schmidt will be talking about the [Open|Web|Content|Education course](http://education.mozilla.org/EduCourse) he's helping us organize, and that we'll be officially announcing this week. Next week (March 23) we'll have Pascal Finette talking to us about the online course Mozilla Labs is putting on as part of the first [Design Challenge](http://labs.mozilla.com/2009/01/introducing-the-design-challenge/). We're still looking for a suitable topic and presenter for the March 30 call; please let me and Dave Humphrey know if you have suggestions. Finally, on April 6 we'll skip the weekly Mozilla call and instead participate in the first of the [teachingopensource.org teleconference calls](http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/TOS_Conference_Call), for anyone interested in the general topic of teaching open source practices. Hope you can join us!
