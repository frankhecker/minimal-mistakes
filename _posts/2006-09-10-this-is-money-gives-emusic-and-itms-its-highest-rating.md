[This is Money](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/), a UK web site by the publisher of the [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/) newspaper, recently published an article [The Best Music Download Sites](http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money-savers/article.html?in_article_id=412502), in which they rated the iTunes Music Store, Napster, MySpace, SpiralFrog, [PlayLouder](http://www.playlouder.com/) (a UK-specific service), the online sites for Virgin and HMV, and band and label sites in general. eMusic received the highest rating (5 stars), along with the iTunes Music Store. The article references the new eMusic UK pricing, mentions iPod compatibility (but _not_ the use of the MP3 format and the lack of DRM restrictions), characterizes eMusic as being for fans of indierock, modern classical and jazz, and delivers the overall verdict Excellent site for the true collector.
