from Digital Music News comes this reminder that the music industry can likely have profits or control, but not both: [Research Group Puts Price Tag on Interoperability Quagmire.](http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/yesterday/june2006#061406drm)

Based on a report by the research group [iSuppli](http://www.isuppli.com/), "The inability of several industries to resolve their differences over DRM could stunt the evolution of future digital markets, while potentially putting 'hundreds of billions of dollars' at risk, ..." Essentially attempts by record labels, equipment makers, and others to over-control consumer use of digital music, video, etc., poisons the overall market by making digital media offering much more complex and hence much less attractive. The winners in all this: companies like Apple that can potentially offer an integrate "one-stop shopping" experience. The losers: record labels, equipment makers other than Apple, the rest of us.
