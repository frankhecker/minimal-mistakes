I'm contemplating ending my Swindleeeee!!!!! blog and moving all the old posts over to my [regular blog](http://blog.hecker.org/), though that might not happen for a while. In the meantime I've started posting some things over at my other blog that might be of interest to anyone still reading this one. The latest one is a long post (over 7,000 words!) on the rather oddball idea of [applying Clayton Christensen's theory of disruptive innovation to music](http://blog.hecker.org/2009/09/06/music-and-the-theory-of-disruptive-innovation/).
