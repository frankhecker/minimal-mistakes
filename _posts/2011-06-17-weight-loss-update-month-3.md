I'm now at the three month mark in the [Newt Gingrich weight loss program](/2011/03/17/the-newt-gingrich-weight-loss-program/), and it's time for another progress report. Just as Newt feels liberated by the [resignation of many of his campaign staffers](http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/06/gingrich-on-staff-resignations-i-frankly-feel-liberated-video.php), I myself again feel liberated from having to carry around excess weight: I weighed in this morning at 70.0 kg, 1.6 kg less than my weight a month ago, 5.0 kg below my official starting weight of 75.0 kg, and right at my goal weight. That's one more month I can spend $10 on myself and not on Newt.

This month's thought:

**Food can be addictive.** David Kessler's book [The End of Overeating](http://www.theendofovereatingbook.com/) has a good discussion of the way the modern diet, especially the modern eat-out or take-out diet, is designed to encourage us to eat more, chiefly via adding salt, sugar, and fat in various enticing combinations. One of the hardest things I've had to do is to resist particular foods that I tended to compulsively overeat, for example tortilla chips at Mexican restaurants. I've found that I have to swear off such foods pretty much entirely and resist the temptation to eat even a little bit. Eventually the craving goes away, at least partially, though I've backslid occasionally.

As I discussed in [a previous weight-loss update](/2011/04/17/weight-loss-update-month-1/), even though I've achieved my goal two months ahead of schedule (having hit my goal weight in three months instead of five) I'll continue to try to lose at least 1 kg a month. My goal for a month from now (July 17) is therefore to be at 69.0 kg or below. I think this is going to be a bit tougher to do, but I take heart from Newt's determination to soldier on.
