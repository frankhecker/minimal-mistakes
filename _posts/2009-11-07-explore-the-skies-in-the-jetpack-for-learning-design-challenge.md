It's now less than three weeks until the November 27 submissions deadline for the [Jetpack for Learning Design Challenge](http://design-challenge.mozilla.org/jetpack-for-learning/). To get folks excited about the challenge [Richard Milewski](http://richard.milewski.org/) has taken Sean Martell's great Jetpack design and put together this awesome [promotional video](http://richard.milewski.org/archives/489) that takes the Jetpack for Learning concept into the third dimension of Second Life. Thanks, Richard!
