What will be built in phase 1 of the Crescent development? The slide presentation given by John DeWolf of Howard Hughes Corporation at the [pre-submission meeting on March 31](/2014/04/01/no-fooling-columbias-becoming-a-city/) provides some details about the phasing of construction, although it’s certainly possible that some of these details may change somewhat prior to the next step in the Howard County approval process. (In fact, it’s possible that some details have changed already, since some of the information on the slides is apparently inconsistent with what has been reported in the Baltimore Sun, for example in [Luke Lavoie’s April 1 story](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/columbia/ph-ho-cf-crescent-meeting-20140331,0,925474.story).)

In particular there are four key slides in John DeWolf’s presentation that laid out the three phases and summarized the final development as completed. In this and subsequent posts I’ll present the information contained in those slides, and provide some of my own comments as appropriate. For background see my overview of the [areas and phases of development](/2014/04/06/the-crescent-development-in-downtown-columbia-areas-and-phases/).

The first key slide was titled “Crescent Neighborhood, Phase 1—1.7 million SF*”; the asterisk referenced a note at the bottom of the slide, “As shown in plan”.1 The graphical portion of the slide showed the following structures within the four areas:



	
  * Area 1

	
    * A single office building in the northern part of the area, to the east of Broken Land Parkway and to the south of Little Patuxent Parkway, at the southeast corner of the intersection.

	
    * A surface parking lot immediately to the south of that building, bordering Broken Land Parkway and occupying the remainder of the area.




	
  * Area 2

	
    * A single office building in the southwest part of the area, bordering the east side of Broken Land Parkway and the north side of a proposed road between Broken Land Parkway and the proposed Crescent West ring road surrounding Merriweather and Symphony Woods.2

	
    * A surface parking lot occupying the remainder of the area.




	
  * Area 3

	
    * Two residential buildings in the north end of the parcel, bordering the south side of Crescent West and facing each other across the proposed South Crescent Park, a rectangular park in the middle of the proposed street from Crescent West into the heart of Area 3.3

	
    * A much smaller building located between the south ends of the two residential buildings, at the southern terminus of South Crescent Park.4

	
    * A proposed concert hall, immediately to the south of the small building.

	
    * A proposed aquatic center, to the west of the concert hall.

	
    * A proposed hotel, convention center, and library, grouped together to the east of the concert hall.

	
    * A parking garage immediately to the south of the hotel, convention center, and library, just north of the undeveloped strip of property that borders the current exit ramp from US 29 to Broken Land Parkway.





  * Area 4


    * This area was shown as remaining undeveloped during this phase.



The remainder of the slide contained a table showing the space usage and other details of the proposed structures, as follows:

Note that a total of approximately 4,255 parking spaces (in both garages and surface lots) were shown as being constructed in phase 1. It’s unclear how many of these spaces might be made available for attendees at events at Merriweather Post Pavilion or in Symphony Woods.

Also note that in addition to Area 4 three parcels in Area 3 were shown as remaining undeveloped during phase 1. These three parcels appear to roughly coincide with the eastern portion of the current outdoor unpaved parking lot used for events at Merriweather Post Pavilion; it’s unclear whether or not some portion of these parcels might be made available for Merriweather event parking during phase 1 construction.

In my next post I’ll present the details for phase 2.


* * *



1. It’s unclear exactly which plan this note is referring to.

2.  The road to the south of Area 2 is a continuation of Hickory Ridge Road, at the location of the more southern entrance to Merriweather from Broken Land Parkway. The Crescent West ring road will replace the current Symphony Woods Road and will separate the Crescent property from Symphony Woods and Merriweather Post Pavilion.

3. Although not shown on this slide, based on other slides in the presentation the two buildings are proposed to each contain an above-ground parking garage.

4. John DeWolf commented during the presentation that he would like the Columbia Association to locate its headquarters in Area 3. This smaller building may be the one he envisioned for that purpose.

5. There was no separate parking garage shown in Area 1 in phase 1, so presumably these spaces are proposed to be in a garage located within the office building. The “+/-” in this and other places presumably indicates that the number of parking spaces is approximate.

6. Presumably “keys” is developer-speak for hotel guest rooms.
