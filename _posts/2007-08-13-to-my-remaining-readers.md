If anyone is still reading this blog, my apologies: I've been preoccupied with work and family matters and haven't posted anything since May. In fact, things got so bad in terms of distractions that I had not one but two months in which I even neglected to use all my eMusic downloads (the horror!). I can't promise to resume the posting frequency of certain times past, but I do have at least one or two new posts coming up in the next few days, and hope to keep additional posts coming on a semi-regular schedule.

I'm also thinking about moving the blog from my own server to [wordpress.com](http://www.wordpress.com/); if I do so I should be able to [keep the current domain name](http://faq.wordpress.com/2006/11/10/domain-mapping/), and I may also be able to ensure that the feed URLs don't change either. I've already imported almost all the old blog posts and comments into the [wordpress.com-hosted version of the blog](http://swindleeeee.wordpress.com/), but want to do some more tweaking and testing before I throw the switch.
