This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending March 7, 2008. (I'm running a bit behind on status reports; the one for last week should be up tomorrow.)


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).

    * [Seneca College announced a $100,000 grant from the Mozilla Foundation](http://www.senecac.on.ca/cms/media/newsdetail.jsp?mediaID=136) to support Seneca's ongoing work with the Mozilla project and its creation of a curriculum for educating Mozilla and open source developers.

  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I gave preliminary approval to the applications from [GeoTrust](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#GeoTrust) and [thawte](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/#thawte) to add new EV-capable roots (bugs [407168](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=407168) and [407163](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=407163) respectively).
