Now that I've gone and [hyped eMusic Selects](http://swindleeeee.com/2008/02/18/emusic-selects-a-strategy/), I feel I've earned the right to make a suggestion, for any eMusic poobahs who may be reading this: As I understand it, eMusic will have monthly Selections, which at two per month adds up to 24 Selections per year. eMusic also has a fairly substantial group of people into classical music, and has been successful in getting subscribers to try out classical releases (as noted in this [recent story](http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20080209/music_nm/classical_dc)).

So, why not have one or two Selections this year to highlight some of the upcoming composers and performers who are bringing a true indie sensibility to the classical music scene? Yancey and friends won't have to go far to get some advice: Justin Davidson recently wrote a [New York article](http://nymag.com/arts/classicaldance/classical/features/43285/) on the next wave of classical scene in New York (highlighting, among others, the good folk at [New Amsterdam Records](https://www.newamsterdamrecords.com/)), and Alex Ross did a [similar article](http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2007/04/16/070416crmu_music_ross) for the New Yorker last year. eMusic could probably find some worthy Selects without even having to leave the five boroughs.

So, come on eMusic: please make us indie classical fans happy in 2008!
