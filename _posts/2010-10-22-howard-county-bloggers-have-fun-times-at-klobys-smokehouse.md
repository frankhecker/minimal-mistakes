I'm not in any shape to blog anything that requires concentrated thought, but I didn't want to let the night pass without noting that I had a great time at the [HoCo blogger (and blog reader) meetup](http://hocoblogs-klobys-smokehouse.eventbrite.com/) at [Kloby's Smokehouse](http://www.klobysbbq.com/) tonight. Due to work and family commitments I don't often get a chance to go out to local events, and to be honest I'm not so politically obsessed that I find attending a [local candidate forum](http://hocorising.blogspot.com/2010/10/hoco-chamber-forum-some-thoughts.html) to be my idea of a good time. So it was good to be someplace where I could meet the people who've been reading my blog and meet other bloggers whom I follow, and where a conversation about local restaurants was as on point as a discussion of local politics.

Some other points: First, this marked the public unveiling of Trevor's new [HoCo Politico blog](http://hocopolitico.blogspot.com/). For the most part I don't occupy the same regions of politicospace as Trevor, but I've enjoyed reading his guest posts at [HoCo Rising](http://hocorising.blogspot.com/), and I will be following him at his new venue. I recommend you do likewise.

Second, I'm by no means a cheerleader for blogging, new media, etc., but I wanted to make a belated comment on [Wordbones's post](http://writing-the-wrongs.blogspot.com/2010/10/problem-with-bloggers.html) relaying Mona Brinegar's complaints about HoCo bloggers supposedly dominating the conversation about local affairs, offering one-sided arguments, and in general being a bad influenceTM. For goodness sake people, if you think local bloggers are presenting one-sided views of the world, start your own blog and present your side of the story. Don't post sniping comments on other people's blogs, or complain in emails to a listserv. It's the Internet, folks, you don't need an Internet drivers license to get on the information superhighway.

Not to pick at these two scabs once more, but I still don't understand why proponents of the [Taxpayer's Protection Initiative](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Howard-County-Taxpayer-Protection-Initiative/131239316905886) and opponents of [downtown Columbia redevelopment](http://www.columbia-md.com/) didn't make their respective cases more aggressively through blogs and related means. Proactive arguments in a venue you control are always more effective than reactive comments made on your enemy's turf.

Finally, thanks to [JessieX](http://hometowncolumbia.wordpress.com/) for promoting the event and [Mr HowChow](http://howchow.blogspot.com/) and [HoCo Rising](http://hocorising.blogspot.com/) for co-hosting it. I was afraid that the expanded attendee list and the presence of [various](http://www.ballinger4boe.com/) [local](http://www.electschrader.com/) [politicos](http://www.electjeffrobinson.com/) and a phalanx of [hyperlocal](http://www.hocomojo.com/) [media](http://columbia.patch.com/) [types](http://ellicottcity.patch.com/) might suck the spontaneity and fun out of the proceedings, but my fears proved unfounded. All in all it was a fun event, and I'm looking forward to the next one.
