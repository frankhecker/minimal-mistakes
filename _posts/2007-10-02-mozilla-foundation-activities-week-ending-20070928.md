This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending September 28. I spent a lot of the week preparing for an upcoming board meeting and working on other internal projects; some of these will be announced in due time.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Legal/IP issues

	
    * I'm still waiting on more feedback on the proposed [corporate contributors agreement](http://hecker.org/mozilla/corporate-cla-public-draft).




	
  * Grants and related activities

	
    * I'm working on a proposal for the board for a set of activities to be funded for the remainder of 2007.




	
  * Web sites

	
    * David mocked up a [proposed revision for the projects page](http://davidwboswell.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/project_page1.jpg) on www.mozilla.org.




	
  * Other

	
    * I started working with Gerv to start transitioning CA-related tasks back to me. Gerv also worked on tasks related to
localization, internationalized domain names, and so on.







#### Upcoming activities





	
  * I had thought about attending the [Mozilla accessibility summit](http://live.gnome.org/Boston2007/AccessibilitySummit/Mozilla) on October 5 in Boston, but due to a minor medical problem and other factors I'll be staying home.

	
  * I'm considering attending one or both days of the Seneca College [Free Software and Open Source Symposium](http://fsoss.senecac.on.ca/2007/) (FSOSS 2007) in Toronto on October 25 and 26.
