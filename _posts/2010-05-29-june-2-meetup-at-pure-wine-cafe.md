I should have mentioned this earlier, but better late than never: I'm co-hosting (with[ Jessie X](http://hometowncolumbia.wordpress.com/)) a blogger meetup this Wednesday evening, June 2, at [Pure Wine Cafe](http://www.purewinecafe.com/) in downtown Ellicott City, from 6:15 pm to 7:45 pm. I went to Pure Wine Cafe a while back, [liked it](http://blog.hecker.org/2009/07/09/relaxing-at-pure-wine-cafe/), and tried to co-host a previous meetup only to mess it up through my own stupidity. (If you're planning to meet somewhere you should call ahead and verify it's open.)

So now we're going back again, finally, and if you're a Howard County blogger or a reader of local blogs you're welcome to stop by. You can RSVP on the [event page](http://hocoblogs-pure-wine-cafe.eventbrite.com/).
