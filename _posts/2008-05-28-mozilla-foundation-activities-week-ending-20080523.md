This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending May 23, 2008.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * Eitan Isaacson completed his Mozilla Foundation-funded work to improve the [Orca open source screen reader for Linux](http://live.gnome.org/Orca). Thanks go to Eitan for all his work on this!

	
    * The Mozilla Foundation is funding [Ben Millard](http://projectcerbera.com/me/) for an accessibility-related project to study how authors use HTML in practice, compare this with the semantics and accessibilty-related features in HTML5, identify any gaps, and help develop realistic ways to fill them.

	
    * The Mozilla Foundation is funding Wellington Fernando de Macedo to help implement in the Mozilla code base [server-sent DOM events](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/section-server-sent-events.html) functionality as specified in HTML5. This is a project originally proposed for the Google Summer of Code; we thought it was a project worth supporting but didn't have enough SoC slots to include it as part of that program.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * As I previously [announced](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.tech.crypto/msg/caaecff480423a69) in the m.d.t.crypto newsgroup, Kathleen Wilson will be assisting me with the task of gathering information about Certificate Authorities that apply for inclusion of their root certificates into Mozilla. I've assigned a number of CA-related bugs to Kathleen, with a priority on getting EV-related requests processed.

	
    * I updated the [pending](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/) and [included](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/included/) lists to reflect changes in Firefox 3 RC1.




	
  * Conferences

	
    * Zak prepared for his keynote at eLiberatica and for the [FOSSCoach](http://fosscoach.wikia.com/wiki/FOSSCoach) event at OSCON.







#### Upcoming events and activities





	
  * Zak will be doing a keynote at the [eLiberatica 2008 conference](https://foundationwiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Events/2008/eLiberatica&action=edit) (May 30-31, 2008, in Bucharest).

	
  * The Mozilla Foundation will be a sponsor of the [Personal Democracy Forum conference](http://pdf2008.confabb.com/conferences/60420-personal-democracy-forum-2008) (June 23-24 in New York NY). Brian Behlendorf will be speaking there, and I'm also planning to attend.
