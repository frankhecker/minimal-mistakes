This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending May 30, 2008.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on that week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * The Mozilla Foundation made a small grant to support the [G3ict](http://g3ict.com/) accessibility initiative. Among other things, G3ict has published a book, [The Accessibility Imperative](http://g3ict.com/resource_center/g3ict_book_-_the_accessibility_imperative), discussing implementation of the [UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities](http://www.un.org/disabilities/convention/conventionfull.shtml) in an IT context. (I have a few copies of this book available for those who want one; please send me an email if you're interested.)




	
  * Legal issues

	
    * Gerv Markham published an update to the [Mozilla Foundation license policy](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/license-policy.html), but held off on publishing the new [Mozilla committer's agreement](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Committers_Agreement) pending a final decision on administrative arrangements for processing the signed forms.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * Gerv worked with others to determine how the [Debian weak key problem](http://wiki.debian.org/SSLkeys) might affect CAs and SSL-enabled web sites.

	
    * Kathleen Wilson worked on gathering information relating to requests from GlobalSign (bugs [406796](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=406794) and [406796](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=406796)), secomtrust (bug [394419](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=394419)), Comodo (bug [421946](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=421946)), Wells Fargo (bug [428390](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=428390)), Verizon/CyberTrust (bugs [430694](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430694), [430698](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430698), and [430700](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=430700)), and TC TrustCenter (bug [436467](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=436467)).

	
    * I communicated with various CAs regarding their planned applications for inclusion of roots in Mozilla, and posted a [draft checklist](http://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Information_checklist) for information needed for evaluating CA requests.




	
  * Public communication

	
    * David Boswell worked with Samuel Sidler on a www.mozilla.org design brief and archiving plan and posted to www.mozilla.org new [featured Mozilla-based applications](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/#poweredby) for June (Google AdWords Editor and Zimbra Desktop).

	
    * David posted a draft copy of a proposed [Mozilla brochure](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2008/05/30/creating-a-mozilla-brochure/) for public review.




	
  * Conferences

	
    * Zak Greant did a keynote presentation at [eLiberatica](http://eliberatica.ro/2008/), and worked on the proposed [FOSSCoach](http://fosscoach.wikia.com/wiki/FOSSCoach) event at OSCON.







#### Upcoming events and activities





	
  * The Mozilla Foundation will be a sponsor of the [Personal Democracy Forum conference](http://pdf2008.confabb.com/conferences/60420-personal-democracy-forum-2008) (June 23-24 in New York NY). Brian Behlendorf will be speaking there, and I'm also planning to attend.


  * David, Gerv, and Zak will be attending OSCON (July 21-25 in Portland OR) and the Firefox Summit (July 29-31 in Whistler BC). I will be attending the Firefox Summit but not OSCON.
