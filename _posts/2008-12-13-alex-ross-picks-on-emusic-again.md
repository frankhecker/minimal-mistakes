Continuing a [tradition from last year](http://swindleeeee.com/2007/11/28/alex-ross-picks-on-emusic/), here's what you can find on eMusic from the [list of recommended 2008 recordings](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/tny/2008/12/alex-rosss-ten-best-recordings.html) published by [Alex Ross](http://www.therestisnoise.com/). (Note that CaptWhiffle also has Alex Ross picks for 2007 and 2008 as a [user list on eMusic](http://www.emusic.com/lists/showlist.html?lid=31865036&nickname=&cs=1#/profile/ajax/lists/showlist.html?lid=31865036&nickname=&cs=1), something I didn't notice until I'd almost finished this post.)





  * [Crystal Tears](http://www.emusic.com/album/Andreas-Scholl-Crystal-Tears-MP3-Download/11201029.html): songs of Dowland, Robert Johnson, Byrd, and others; Andreas Scholl, countertenor, Julian Behr, lute and Concerto di viole ([Harmonia Mundi](http://www.emusic.com/features/hub/harmoniamundi/index.html)). This is 21 tracks (about half of my monthly allotment), but I like early music and the samples sound good, so this is a likely download for me.



  * [Heavenly Harmonies](http://www.emusic.com/album/Stile-Antico-Heavenly-Harmonies-Music-of-Thomas-Tallis-Will-MP3-Download/11179072.html): music of Tallis and Byrd; Stile Antico ([Harmonia Mundi](http://www.emusic.com/features/hub/harmoniamundi/index.html)). Same story as for Crystal Tears.



  * [Chopin, Preludes, and pieces by Mompou](http://www.emusic.com/album/Alexandre-Tharaud-Chopin-Pr%C3%A9ludes-Op-28-MP3-Download/11144532.html); Alexandre Tharaud, piano ([Harmonia Mundi](http://www.emusic.com/features/hub/harmoniamundi/index.html)). This is not on CaptWhiffle's list, probably because it was released late in the year.



  * [Brahms and Schumann Lieder](http://www.emusic.com/album/Lorraine-Hunt-Lieberson-Schumann-Frauenliebe-und-leben-Brahms-8-Songs-MP3-Download/11299059.html); Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, mezzo-soprano, and Julius Drake, piano (Wigmore Hall Live).



Several releases on eMusic were also on Ross's honorable mention list; some of these are missing from CaptWhiffle's list:





  * [Beethoven’s Symphonies Nos. 2 and 7](http://www.emusic.com/album/Osmo-Vanska-BEETHOVEN-van-L-Symphonies-Nos-2-and-7-Minnes-MP3-Download/11284386.html), with Osmo Vänskä conducting the Minnesota Orchestra ([BIS](http://www.emusic.com/lists/showlist.html?lid=19746927)).



  * [Piano works by Salonen, Stucky, and Lutosławski](http://www.emusic.com/album/Gloria-Cheng-Piano-Music-of-Salonen-Stucky-and-Lutoslawski-MP3-Download/11241811.html), with Gloria Cheng (Telarc).



  * [Elliott Carter’s Quartets Nos. 1 and 5](http://www.emusic.com/album/Pacifica-Quartet-CARTER-String-Quartets-Nos-1-and-5-MP3-Download/11135708.html), with the Pacifica Quartet ([Naxos](http://www.emusic.com/label/Naxos-MP3-Download/110399.html)). [Elliott Carter's 100th birthday](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/arts/music/12carter.html) was yesterday, so you can download this as a belated birthday gesture if you forgot to send a card.



  * [Volume 4 of Beethoven’s Piano Sonatas](http://www.emusic.com/album/Paul-Lewis-Beethoven-Piano-Sonatas-Vol-4-MP3-Download/11271832.html), with Paul Lewis (Harmonia Mundi). 29 tracks, but even the MP3 release on Amazon is $27.49.



  * [Now](http://www.emusic.com/album/Now-Ensemble-Now-MP3-Download/11181056.html), The NOW Ensemble (New Amsterdam). I really like this album, and wrote about it previously in the context of the [indie classical scene](http://swindleeeee.com/2008/02/24/now-ensemble-and-more-on-indie-classical/) and the role of [New Amsterdam Records](http://www.newamsterdamrecords.com/) within it. New Amsterdam is attracting a lot of interesting artists to its roster (e.g., [Corey Dargel](http://www.automaticheartbreak.com/), [Victrola](http://www.myspace.com/victrolavictrola), [Build](http://www.myspace.com/buildbuildbuild)); some of them I find somewhat meh, but others I really like. Being able to cheaply explore releases from labels like New Amsterdam is one of the great things about eMusic; 



  * [Mothertongue](http://www.emusic.com/album/Nico-Muhly-Mothertongue-MP3-Download/11211078.html), Nico Muhly (Bedroom Community/Brassland). I really liked Muhly's [Speaks Volumes](http://www.amazon.com/Speaks-Volumes/dp/B00169YISO/?tag=frankhecker-20) (not on eMusic), but after listening to this one a few times I'm still having problems getting into it. The [Sequenza21 review](http://www.sequenza21.com/cdreviews/?p=314) captures some of my concerns.



  * [Scattered Rhymes](http://www.emusic.com/album/The-Orlando-Consort-Scattered-Rhymes-MP3-Download/11198309.html) (works of O’Regan, Machaut, Bryars, and Dufay), with the Orlando Consort and Paul Hillier conducting the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir ([Harmonia Mundi](http://www.emusic.com/features/hub/harmoniamundi/index.html)).



Ross also posted a list of what he considers to be the [ten best performances of 2008](http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/tny/2008/12/alex-rosss-ten-best-performanc.html). This is also interesting, and provided me at least one suggestion for future eMusic exploration.
