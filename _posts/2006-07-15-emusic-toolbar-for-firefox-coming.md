As part of my [day job](http://www.hecker.org/mozilla/) I try to keep track of what's happening in the various [Mozilla discussion forums](http://www.mozilla.org/community/developer-forums.html). Today I happened an interesting post in the [mozilla.jobs forum](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.jobs/): "[XPCOM/XUL developer needed at eMusic.com (New York, Manhattan)](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.jobs/msg/b5545abc81e2deb8)". Based on the information in the post it appears that eMusic is looking to develop future eMusic client software based on [Mozilla technologies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_application_framework) used in the Firefox browser.

My best guess is that eMusic is planning to develop a Firefox-compatible version of the [eMusic toolbar for IE](http://www.emusic.com/toolbar/download.html); such a toolbar would be developed as a [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions.php?app=firefox) using the technologies (XUL, XPCOM, etc.) mentioned in the job listing. (Note that an [eMusic toolbar for Firefox](http://emusictoolbar.mozdev.org/) already is available from a third party, but is not officially supported by eMusic.) A more remote possibility is that eMusic is planning to develop a standalone Mozilla-based application, e.g., a replacement for the current [eMusic download manager](http://www.emusic.com/dlm/download.html) or an eMusic equivalent to [iTunes](http://www.apple.com/itunes/). A twist on the latter possibility is that eMusic could piggyback on the Mozilla-based [Songbird media player](http://www.songbirdnest.com/home) currently in development, either adding eMusic-specific extensions to Songbird or doing an eMusic-specific version.

In the end although an eMusic/Songbird combination would be quite interesting, I think a Firefox version of the eMusic toolbar is more likely, both because it's a natural extension of the current eMusic toolbar concept, and also because it could leverage the large Firefox user base. However whatever is developed it's clear that it will support all three major platforms: Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. That's great news for all eMusic users.
