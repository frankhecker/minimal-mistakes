Really, everyone getting excited about [SpiralFrog's announcement](http://www.spiralfrog.com/press_release.aspx) should just stop reading fevered pronouncements like [a huge blow to established music stores such as iTunes, eMusic, and Urge](http://blog.scifi.com/tech/archives/2006/08/29/universal_gives.html) and see [what Bob Lefsetz has to say](http://lefsetz.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2006/08/29/spiralfrog/):


<blockquote>Rental, and make no mistake, SpiralFrog is rental, it’s just that you pay for it with your eyeballs/time as opposed to cash, has been proven to be a failure. ...

Ignore ridiculous pronouncements of well-endowed vaporware and get down in the pit with the proletariat....

A lot of unprotected music for a low price that you own permanently.  This is the only solution.  To think otherwise is to be ignorant.</blockquote>


And who offers unprotected music for a low price that you own permanently? Hint: [it's a swindleeeee!!!!!](http://www.emusic.com/)
