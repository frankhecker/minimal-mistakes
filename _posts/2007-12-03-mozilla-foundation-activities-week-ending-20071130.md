This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozillafoundation.org/) for the week ending November 30, 2007.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * Steve Lee provided a [report on his participation in the RAatE conference](http://eduspaces.net/stevelee/weblog/225753.html). (Steve's [Jambu](http://www.oatsoft.org/trac/jambu) project has received funding from the Foundation.)

	
    * I received some new grant proposals for the board's consideration.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I worked on the applications for inclusion from [SwissSign](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=343756) and [TÃœRKTRUST](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380635), as well as on the EV applications from [VeriSign](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=402947) and [QuoVadis](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=403665).

	
    * I made updates to the [pending list](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/certs/pending/) to reflect the current status of CA applications.

	
    * I created a wiki page to track [recommended practices relating to CA applications](http://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:Recommended_Practices).




	
  * Web sites

	
    * David Boswell posted a proposed [new Mozilla Foundation page mockup](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/2007/11/29/adding-some-what-and-why-to-the-mozilla-foundation-site/) for comment.







#### Upcoming trips and events





	
  * I'm planning to be in Mountain View on December 11 (afternoon only) and 12.
