Well, sort of... One of our proposed [Mozilla education activities](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Foundation:Planning:Education) for 2009 is creating a central [web site for Mozilla educational resources](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Foundation:Planning:Education:EDMO) and related content and activities. We don't have a standalone site yet, but we do have the [education.mozilla.org](http://education.mozilla.org/) domain now up and redirecting to the [Mozilla Education section](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education) of the Mozilla wiki.

Keep an eye on the site as we continue to add more content over the coming weeks. Also, please feel free to add relevant content yourself; follow the [site naming conventions](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/Site/NamingConventions) so that we can keep consistency in our URLs.

Note that we also have a #education IRC channel accessible via irc.mozilla.org (with almost thirty people in the channel as I write), and of course our weekly [Mozilla Education status calls](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/StatusMeetings) (next one coming up soon). If you're interested in Mozilla and education please stop by and get involved!
