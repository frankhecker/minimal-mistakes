No, Alex Ross (of The Rest is Noise fame, both [blog](http://www.therestisnoise.com/) and [book](http://www.amazon.com/Rest-Noise-Listening-Twentieth-Century/dp/0374249393/?tag=frankhecker-20)) isn't being mean to eMusic; in fact to my knowledge he's never mentioned it, at least on his blog. What I mean is that several of the releases on [Ross's list of recommended CDs](http://www.therestisnoise.com/cd_picks/index.html) (CDs? how last century!) can be found on eMusic:



	
  * Steve Reich, [Music for 18 Musicians](http://www.emusic.com/album/Grand-Valley-State-University-New-Music-Ensemble-Steve-Reich-Music-for-18-Musicians-MP3-Download/11107102.html), Grand Valley State University New Music Ensemble (Innova). This is an excellent version in my opinion. It doesn't quite measure up to the [original recording](http://www.amazon.com/Steve-Reich-Music-18-Musicians/dp/B000026258/?tag=frankhecker-20) to my ears, but I think it's superior to the [version](http://www.amazon.com/Music-18-Musicians-Jeanne-LeBlanc/dp/B000006E4C/?tag=frankhecker-20) that the <strike>Bang on a Can All-Stars</strike> Steve Reich Ensemble did a while back for Nonesuch. And you can't beat the human interest story: [music students from the midwest](http://www.newmusicensemble.org/) take on Reich and [wow the big city sophisticates](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/arts/music/05bang.html).

	
  * John Luther Adams, [Red Arc/Blue Veil](http://www.emusic.com/album/John-Luther-Adams-Red-Arc-Blue-Veil-MP3-Download/11105787.html) (Cold Blue). Amusingly enough, eMusic thinks John Luther Adams is a new age composer who writes chamber music ([The Mathematics of Resonant Bodies](http://www.emusic.com/album/John-Luther-Adams-Steven-Schick-The-Mathematics-Of-Resonant-Bodies-MP3-Download/10912530.html)) and avante-garde jazz (this work and [The Light That Fills the World](http://www.emusic.com/album/John-Luther-Adams-The-Light-That-Fills-the-World-MP3-Download/10997885.html)).

	
  * Mozart, [Don Giovanni](http://www.emusic.com/album/Ren%C3%A9-Jacobs-Mozart-Don-Giovanni-MP3-Download/11097430.html), René Jacobs conducting (Harmonia Mundi). Note that this release totals a whopping 61 tracks, so it will wipe out a month or two of downloads; however it's still a better bargain than paying [$39.49 for the CD at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Mozart-Giovanni-Pendatchanska-Pasichnyk-Guerzoni/dp/B000SKJR10/?tag=frankhecker-20).

	
  * Stockhausen, [Stimmung](http://www.emusic.com/album/Paul-Hillier-Theatre-of-Voices-Stockhausen-Stimmung-MP3-Download/11077559.html), Theatre of Voices (Harmonia Mundi).

	
  * Common Sense Composers’ Collective, [tic](http://www.emusic.com/album/New-Millennium-Ensemble-TIC-MP3-Download/11011643.html), with the New Millenium Ensemble (Troy).

	
  * Beethoven, [Piano Sonatas vol. 3](http://www.emusic.com/album/Paul-Lewis-Beethoven-Piano-Sonatas-vol-3-MP3-Download/11095732.html), Paul Lewis (Harmonia Mundi). 32 tracks, but still a better deal than [paying $39.49 at Amazon](//www.amazon.com/Beethoven-Piano-Sonatas-vol-3/dp/B000T2OMWQ/?tag=frankhecker-20).

	
  * Bach, [Goldberg Variations](http://www.emusic.com/album/Simone-Dinnerstein-J-S-Bach-Goldberg-Variations-MP3-Download/11117599.html), Simone Dinnerstein (Telarc). As DennisinWAState mentions in his review, at 32 tracks for most eMusic subscribers it's probably more cost-effective to [pay $12.97 for the CA at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Bach-Goldberg-Variations-J-S/dp/B000SQJ2X2/?tag=frankhecker-20).

	
  * Brahms, [String Sextets](http://www.emusic.com/album/The-Nash-Ensemble-Brahms-The-String-Sextets-MP3-Download/11045844.html), Nash Ensemble (Onyx).

	
  * [Lorraine Hunt Lieberson: Live from Wigmore Hall, 1998](http://www.emusic.com/album/Lorraine-Hunt-Lieberson-Various-Lorraine-Hunt-Lieberson-Roger-Vignole-MP3-Download/11025440.html); with Roger Vignoles, piano (BBC)

	
  * Roussel, [Symphony No. 3 and Bacchus et Ariane](http://www.emusic.com/album/Stephane-Deneve-Albert-Roussel-Bacchus-and-Aradne-complete-Sui-MP3-Download/11035717.html); Stéphane Denève conducting the Royal Scottish National Orchestra (Naxos).

	
  * [As Steals the Morn...: Handel Arias and Scenes](http://www.emusic.com/album/Mark-Padmore-Vitaliano-Handel-As-Steals-The-Morn-Arias-Scenes-for-Te-MP3-Download/11028456.html); Mark Padmore, tenor, with Andrew Manze conducting the English Concert (Harmonia Mundi).

	
  * Gershwin, [Piano Concerto in F, Rhapsody in Blue, Cuban Overture](http://www.emusic.com/album/Jon-Nakamatsu-Gershwin-Piano-Concerto-in-F-Rhapsody-in-Blue-C-MP3-Download/11028463.html); Jon Nakamatsu, piano, with Jeff Tyzik conducting the Rochester Philhamonic (Harmonia Mundi).

	
  * Alexandra Gardner, [Luminoso](http://www.emusic.com/album/Alexandra-Gardner-Luminoso-MP3-Download/10961862.html) (Innova).


Note that of 18 items on Ross's list, 13 are on eMusic. This is yet another example of how eMusic is becoming a great site for classical music, especially for people like me who want to explore contemporary classical works at relatively low expense.
