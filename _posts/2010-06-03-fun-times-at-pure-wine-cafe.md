Thanks to all those who showed up at tonight's HoCo Blogtail meetup at [Pure Wine Cafe](http://www.purewinecafe.com/). Blogs represented included [Annethologie](http://annethologie.blogspot.com/) (more active recently as [@Annathema](http://twitter.com/annathema) on Twitter), [ChrisBachmann.com](http://chrisbachmann.com/), [Columbia Compass](http://columbiacompass.blogspot.com/), [Do I Amuse You](http://morucci.blogspot.com/), [HoCo Rising](http://hocorising.blogspot.com/), [Hometown Columbia](http://hometowncolumbia.wordpress.com/), and [Patapsco Holler](http://0bject.wordpress.com/PatapscoHoller/).

We had some fun conversations about Howard County politics and related issues, though I have to say I'm a bit leery of going down that particular rabbit hole. To be high-minded, I'd prefer to maintain a [beginner's mind](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) as much as possible. To be low-minded, ignorance makes it easier and more fun to blog since I can put forward semi-informed opinions and don't have to worry about the nuance inherent in the real world.

Finally, I wanted to note the hospitality shown us by PJ Strain and the staff of Pure Wine Cafe. PJ in particular went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. I hope we get the HoCo Blogtail meetups back on a regular schedule, and get back to Pure Wine Cafe sometime in the next few months.
