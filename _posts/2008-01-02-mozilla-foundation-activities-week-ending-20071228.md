This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the weeks ending December 14, December 21, and December 28, 2007.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on in the last three weeks; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * A number of significant grant proposals were approved in December; I'll make public announcements on these soon and will update the [2007 grants report](http://hecker.org/mozilla/foundation-grants-2007) to reflect all 2007 activities.

	
    * Eitan Isaacson completed work on a Mozilla Foundation-funded project to improve performance of the [Orca](http://live.gnome.org/Orca) open source screen reader; for more information see GNOME bugs [446277](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=446277), [495077](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=495077), [502924](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=502924), and [491756](http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=491756), as well as Marco Zehe's report on the overall [improvements to Orca performance with Firefox 3](http://www.marcozehe.de/2007/12/21/orca-is-gearing-up-with-firefox/). Eitan is now working on a new Foundation-funded project to enhance the Braille output of Orca, including adding support for [contracted Braille](http://www.dotlessbraille.org/braillecontractions.htm).




	
  * Licensing and legal

	
    * I looked over the proposed [replacement for the CVS contributor form](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=342029) to determine what's needed to complete the project.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I went over the application for inclusion from [TÃœRKTRUST](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=380635) and all the public comments prior to making a final decision on approval.




	
  * Web sites

	
    * David Boswell worked more on proposed changes to www.mozilla.org.




	
  * Other

	
    * Gerv had [surgery](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/2007/12/operation_date_confirmed.html) and is now back home [recovering](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/archives/2007/12/out_of_hospital.html).

	
    * Zak worked on Mozilla Foundation participation in various upcoming events.







#### Upcoming trips and events





	
  * I'm planning to attend the [Freedom to Connect](http://freedom-to-connect.net/) conference March 31 and April 1, 2008 in Silver Spring MD.
