What will be built in phase 3 of the Crescent development? In this post I continue my discussion of key slides from the slide presentation given by John DeWolf of Howard Hughes Corporation at the [pre-submission meeting on March 31](/2014/04/01/no-fooling-columbias-becoming-a-city/); for more background see my overview of the [areas and phases of development](/2014/04/06/the-crescent-development-in-downtown-columbia-areas-and-phases/) and my previous posts on [phase 1](/2014/04/07/the-crescent-development-in-downtown-columbia-phase-1/) and [phase 2](/2014/04/08/the-crescent-development-in-downtown-columbia-phase-2/). As before, the usual caveat applies: some of these details may change somewhat prior to the next step in the Howard County approval process, and some may have changed already prior to the pre-submission meeting but after the slide presentation was prepared.

The third key slide in John DeWolf’s presentation was titled “Crescent Neighborhood, Phase 3—1.75 million SF*”; the asterisk referenced a note at the bottom of the slide, “As shown in plan”.1 The graphical portion of the slide showed the following _new_ structures within the four areas, in addition to those constructed in phase 1 and phase 2 and shown in the first two key slides:2



	
  * Area 4

	
    * A new office building in the northern portion of this area, bordering the south side of Little Patuxent Parkway and the east side of Crescent West.3


    * Another new and much smaller building in the southern portion of this area, bordering the east side of Crescent West.4




	
  * Area 1

	
    * A new office building in the southern part of the area, joining the previous two office buildings constructed in phase 1 and phase 2. This new building was shown as immediately to the south of the parking garage constructed in phase 2, bordering the east side of Broken Land Parkway, and as replacing the last remaining portion of the surface lot constructed in phase 1.

	
    * Another new and much smaller building immediately to the south of the office building constructed in phase 2 and immediately to the east of the office building constructed in phase 3.5




	
  * Area 2

	
    * A new office building in the eastern part of the area, bordering the west side of the proposed Crescent West ring road.

	
    * An expansion of the parking garage constructed in phase 2, extending it to the east. This expanded garage and the new office building were shown as completely replacing the remaining portion of the surface parking lot constructed in phase 1.




	
  * Area 3

	
    * Two new residential buildings in the eastern part of the area. The first of these buildings was shown as immediately to the east of the two residential buildings constructed in phase 1, south of Crescent West, on the east side of the proposed South Crescent Promenade, and to the west of the proposed North-South Connector road.6 The second of these was shown as to the south of the first building and to the east of the hotel, conference center, library, and their associated parking garage.





The remainder of the slide contained a table showing the space usage and other details of the proposed structures; note that these numbers represent both new construction in phase 3 and (where noted) construction in phase 1 and phase 2:

Note that a total of approximately 11,405 parking spaces (all in garages) were shown as being available as a result of construction in phase 3. It’s unclear how many of these spaces might be made available for attendees at events at Merriweather Post Pavilion or in Symphony Woods. Also note that this figure is considerably higher than the figure of 4,360 total parking spaces quoted in [Luke Lavoie’s April 1 story](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/howard/columbia/ph-ho-cf-crescent-meeting-20140331,0,925474.story) in the Baltimore Sun; it’s unclear what the source of the discrepancy might be.

In my next post I’ll present the details from a fourth key slide presenting an overview of the entire Crescent development project.

1. It’s unclear exactly which plan this note is referring to.

2. In this list and in the table below I’ve retained the ordering on the slide, in which Area 4 is listed first.

3. As noted previously, the proposed Crescent West ring road in general separates the Crescent development from Symphony Woods and Merriweather, with the Crescent development generally being to the south and west of Crescent West. Area 4 is the only exception to that.

4. It’s unclear whether this smaller building is intended for office use or for some other purpose.

5. It’s unclear whether this smaller building is intended for office use or for some other purpose.

6. The proposed North-South Connector was shown as a continuation of the exit ramp from US 29 South that currently ends at a traffic signal on Broken Land Parkway. The North South Connector would head north-northeast from that signal, passing to the west of the current location of Toby’s Dinner Theater, and end at Little Patuxent Parkway. Although not shown on this slide, based on other slides in the presentation at least one and possibly both of these residential buildings are proposed to contain an above-ground parking garage.

7. This represents spaces in the parking garages constructed in Area 1 in phases 1 and 2.

8. This represents spaces in the parking garages constructed in Area 2 in phases 1 and 2.

9. This represents spaces in the parking garages constructed in Area 3 in phases 1 and 2.
