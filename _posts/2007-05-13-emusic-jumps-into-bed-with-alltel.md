From time to time I like to highlight eMusic-related business deals. Here's a new one (_not_ mentioned on the [eMusic press release page](http://www.emusic.com/about/pr/index.html)): eMusic will be the featured music provider for [Jump Music](http://www.alltel.com/axcess/music_details.html?id=4), a [new service](http://www.alltel.com/corporate/media/news/07/may/n411may1107a.html) from [Alltel Wireless](http://www.alltel.com/corporate/) that lets cellular subscribers download music from their PCs to their mobile phones. Alltel is the fifth-largest wireless provider in the US, and is rumored to be an [candidate for acquisition](http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=199500218) either by private equity firms or by Verizon. (Both Verizon and Alltel use CDMA technology.) Although Alltel claims to have the largest wireless network in the US (based on [geographic extent](http://www.alltel.com/corporate/media/coverage.html) presumably, not on total number of subscribers) it's not that well known because its main markets are in the [flyover states](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyover_country).

Presumably Alltel picked eMusic both because it offers lots of DRM-free music (making it easy to work with MP3-capable mobile phones) and also because as number 2 behind the iTunes Store it's willing to do deals with smaller companies (as I noted in my discussion of the [Johnny Rockets deal](http://swindleeeee.com/2006/10/07/like-burgers-and-fries-johnny-rockets-and-emusic/)). As Apple and AT&T prepare to roll out the iPhone it will be interesting to see what other US-based mobile operators do to match the iPhone/iTunes offering. It may be that eMusic has had similar discussions with other mobile operatorsâ€”I guess we'll see.

In any case I can amuse myself with the thought of the [city](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City) slickers from eMusic visiting the quiet burb of [Little Rock, Arkansas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Rock,_Arkansas) (Alltel's headquarters) to hammer out the deal. I hope they had a chance to stop by the [Bill Clinton museum](http://www.clintonlibrary.gov/) and catch a glimpse of one of his [saxophones](http://clinton4.nara.gov/media/gif/b_sax.gif).
