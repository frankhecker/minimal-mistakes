My apologies for not passing this on earlier: [Universidad Rey Juan Carlos](http://www.urjc.es/version_ingles/main.htm) in Madrid, Spain, is organizing a three-month course on Mozilla technologies in cooperation with the Mozilla Foundation and Mozilla Europe. The course is almost completely on-line, but it includes a one-week face-to-face sprint session in Madrid in July; students are welcome to apply for financial help with travel costs for the Madrid portion of the course.

The course is open to international students and will be taught in English. You can find further information--including a course outline, important dates, FAQ, and a forum--at [mozilla.libresoft.es](http://mozilla.libresoft.es/). The deadline for applications has been extended to June 20, so get your applications in soon!
