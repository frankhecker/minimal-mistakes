This is my report on activities related to the [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/) for the week ending May 16, 2008.


#### Projects for the week


Here's a summary of what Foundation-related activities went on last week; for more information about others' activities please see the weekly status reports published by [David Boswell](http://davidwboswell.wordpress.com/), [Gerv Markham](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/gerv/), and [Zak Greant](http://zak.greant.com/).



	
  * Grants and related expenditures

	
    * Eitan Isaacson published an [update](http://monotonous.org/2008/05/16/orca-doings/) on his Mozilla Foundation-funded work to improve the [Orca open source screen reader for Linux](http://live.gnome.org/Orca).

	
    * The [Perl Foundation](http://www.perlfoundation.org/) received a [$200,000 donation to support Perl 6 development](http://www.perlfoundation.org/tpf_receives_large_donation_in_support_of_perl_6_development). Among other things, this donation will be used for continuation of Patrick Michaud's Perl 6 work, for which the Mozilla Foundation made a $10,000 seed grant.




	
  * Legal issues

	
    * We got final legal signoff for the proposed new [Mozilla committer's agreement](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Committers_Agreement); Gerv is now working to get an official copy of this agreement and related information posted to www.mozilla.org.




	
  * CAs and related issues

	
    * I found someone to help clear the backlog of CA requests.




	
  * Public communications and related issues

	
    * David continued work on the www.mozilla.org site.




	
  * Conferences

	
    * We have more blog posts from the Mozilla accessibility team's attendance of [SightCity 2008](http://www.sightcity.net/index-e.html), including [one from Steve Lee](http://eduspaces.net/stevelee/weblog/347641.html) and an almost minute-by-minute [account by Ben Millard](http://projectcerbera.com/blog/2008/05#day10).

	
    * Zak prepared for upcoming conference appearances.







#### Upcoming events and activities





	
  * Zak will be doing a keynote at the [eLiberatica 2008 conference](https://foundationwiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Events/2008/eLiberatica&action=edit) (May 30-31, 2008, in Bucharest).

	
  * The Mozilla Foundation will be a sponsor of the [Personal Democracy Forum conference](http://pdf2008.confabb.com/conferences/60420-personal-democracy-forum-2008) (June 23-24 in New York NY), which I'm planning to attend if possible.
