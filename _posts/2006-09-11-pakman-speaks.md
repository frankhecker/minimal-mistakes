Public comments from David Pakman (President and CEO of eMusic) are always interesting even when he's repeating his favorite mantras (e.g., about eMusic and Apple being the only two services that can sell music for iPods). Since I often find myself quoting from them, I thought I'd provide links to various of Pakman's interviews, speeches, and other public comments, both for my own use and as a public service:



	
  * [Music With No Strings Attached](http://www.forbes.com/leadership/2007/04/21/music-digital-downloads-lead-manage-cx_lh_0420emusic.html) (Forbes, April 21, 2007). A very interesting and informative interview in the wake of the Amazon rumors (to which Pakman responds there are no talks right now with any strategic buyer). Pakman also addresses eMusic's market niche (Our differentiation will not be in the format. It'll be who we serve as customers), notes that eMusic would be interested in only a portion of EMI's catalog, downplays the threat of labels leaving eMusic (We've got 13,000 labels on the service. Fewer than five have ever left.), explains eMusic's subscription model and the motivation behind the Connoisseur plan (For us, subscription business optimization is about making sure customers are never always maxing out their plans.), and even speculates about possible eMusic interest in long-tail television. A must-read interview.

	
  * [Startups eye Apple-EMI pact](http://www.redherring.com/Article.aspx?a=21854&hed=Startups+Eye+Apple-EMI+Pact) (Red Herring, April 2, 2007). Pakman praises EMI's willingness to license music in DRM-free formats, and looks forward to eMusic doing a deal with EMI.

	
  * [Gigs & Bytes: eMusic's Pak Attack](http://www.pollstar.com/news/viewnews.pl?NewsID=7805) (Pollstar, March 30, 2007). Pakman riffs on the standard topics: the importance of interoperability, the reluctance of major labels to experiment with their back catalogs, and eMusic as a music discovery service. Most notably, he claims the eMusic has plenty of room to grow the business (We really do believe there are 3 million to 5 million potential eMusic subscribers just today) and has no near-term plans to sell out to someone else. He also claims that the average eMusic customer spends $14 per month, which combined with a subscriber base of well north of 250,000 gives a revenue estimate for eMusic of  almost $50 million per year.

	
  * [Apple gets behind the album offer with new format](http://www.reuters.com/article/technology-media-telco-SP/idUSN2941958220070329) (Reuters, March 29, 2007). Pakman reacts to Apple's announcement of the new Complete My Album feature of the iTunes Store: The premise that the album is dead is only true among the youth segment, which is really the iTunes customer. The article also notes that over 60 percent of all [eMusic's] downloads were full-length albums, although it doesn't clarify what this actually means. (My best guess is that 60 percent of the tracks downloaded from eMusic were downloaded as part of a complete album download, rather than as individual tracks.)

	
  * [eMusic CEO: DRM Will Be Dead by 2008](http://news.independent.co.uk/business/news/article2296888.ece) (The Independent, February 23, 2007). Pakman continues on his anti-DRM crusade, claims Steve Jobs was a bit disingenuous in his comments on DRM, and pleads that If we're still talking about DRM in five years, please take me out and shoot me.

  * [Music Ally Debate, London: Buzz Of The Indies](http://www.paidcontent.org/music-ally-debate-london-buzz-of-the-indies) (paidcontent.org, July 19, 2006). Summary of Pakman's comments at the Music Ally event. Interesting tidbits:

	
    * "Pakman said [eMusic] pays an average $5.62 per customer, per month, back to [independent] labels..."

	
    * "Pakman quoted 4.5 million downloads per month and a catalog of 1.5 million tracks..."
