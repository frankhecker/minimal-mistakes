This post is for the WordPress.com support staff, to try to demonstrate a problem with their new Minileven theme for mobile devices; everyone else can ignore it. This post was composed using the HTML panel of the Add New Post page.

Using the HTML <q> tag:

Hi there, he said, are you a blogger?

Using traditional ASCII double and single quotation marks:

"Hi there", he said, "are you a 'blogger'?"

Using curling quotation marks expressed as HTML numeric character entities (8220 and 8221 for double quotation marks, 8216 and 8217 for single quotation marks):

"Hi there", he said, "are you a 'blogger'?"

Using curling quotation marks expressed as HTML character entities (ldquo and rdquo for double quotation marks, lsquo and rsquo for single quotation marks):

"Hi there", he said, "are you a 'blogger'?"

Using curling quotation marks entered directly as Unicode characters on my Mac (option-[ and option-shift-[ for left and right double quotation marks,  and option-] and option-shift-] for left and right single quotation marks):

“Hi there”, he said, “are you a ‘blogger’?”
