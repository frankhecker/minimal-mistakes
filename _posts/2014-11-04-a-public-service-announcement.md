tl;dr: Vote for Tom Coale for Maryland House of Delegates, District 9B.

Before I publish my main post for today, a brief public service announcement: If you live in District 9B and haven’t yet voted, please consider giving [Tom Coale](http://tomcoale.com) your vote for Delegate. For the most part this is a nonpartisan blog, and I have a pretty strict policy of not endorsing candidates for office, even for nonpartisan positions like those on the Board of Education. The [only exception I’ve ever made](/2013/06/22/tom-coale-for-delegate-in-district-9b/) (and likely ever will make) is for Tom. I think he would make a great representative for the people of Ellicott City; my only regret is that I live across US 40 from District 9B and can’t vote for him. (Although if Tom wins this election and performs at the level I think he’s capable of, I think in future I and a lot of other people will in fact get our chance to elect him to something else.)
