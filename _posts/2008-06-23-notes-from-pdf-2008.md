Jane Hampshire of FireDogLake:
thoughts on competition from MSM now moving in blogs and other web 2.0 stuff
"recontextualize media narrative"
blogs as way to channel energy into political action
create ads that get viewed, repurposed, etc. 
contrast with people concerned about their "cocktail party access".
willing to take on people in own party
(this is ultimately a issue around professionalism: for the people who do well at this, will become full-time activity and possibly a living. firedoglake model seems to imply model of partisan media outlets serving audience of partisans)
concern about balance of power in house held by middle-of-the-road conservative Democrats and allied Republicans
example of Barack Obama not being beholden to "fat cats"

Patrick Ruffini of nextright
traditionally right-wing blogosphere focused on three key issues: war, fiscal restraint, conservative judges (basically national security coalition)
talk radio as "legacy conservative media"
example of generating calls re immigration bill
"governing ethos"
now new facets of coalition coming online
ex: Mike Huckabee and online evangelical community
quotes Zephyr Techout on excellence of Huckabee online campaign
had to build own community

ex: Ron Paul
2 lessons on how right can innovate online and leapfrog
1. online fundraising (contrast Obama fundraising driven by email solicitations)
2. follow up at local party organizational level
"small networked groups beats large atomized group"
campaigns dependent on high follar model lost, campaigns based on organic enthusiasm won or did better than expected
"need to clean our house" before taking battle to Democracts?
John Hinkey (sp?) thinks unity will depend on shared grievance
how do we use new movement to proscribe positive agenda for country
crowd-sourced wikified 21s centurty contract for America

Micah: Is power of netrotts realy dependent on outrage, stopping something?

Jane: hard to say. ex: Obama enthusiasm in part dependent on 
(me: to what extent might this depend on ability of people to see incremental improvement in state of affaris -- analgous with open source release early release often)

Patrick: ex: Newt Gingrich's drill now campaign

Q: Lenore Falani (fringe presidential candidate): where do independents fit?

Jane: independents are not necessarily true independents, tend to be party-identified
Patrick: echoes this, points out that independents has decreased 

Q. Q re left and right alliances, e.g., on FISA. Why are national security conservatives not joining left/right coalition on FISA.

Clay Shirky
recapitalation of HCE: "Internet makes group action easier"
examples
however; most examples are of "stop energy"
"amount of starting/sustaining energy on web is amazing"
maybe collective action is harder
requires much higher commitment to group and groups's shared goals
but still have examples:
e.g., barn raising
why build barn: becuaae I owe you favor, or want you to owe me favor
occur in density of peorple is hgh enough to enable receiporcal favors
density and continuity
this is problem for Internet
hypothesis:
Free software licensing structure (GPL) is example of missing 
what is equivalent of GPL for Internet collective action?
exaples: "virtual company project" ("do tank", democracy design workshop, in Vermont)
incorporation is the way state recognizes groups
"community interest companies" in UK
for-profit company with inalienable social goals at heart of enterprise
 meetup alliances: groups connecting together across multple online venuesl (?) (ex. MomsTown, Athiest Alliance)

Session for data geeks"
catalist: (catalist.us): 80 organizations as clients
matches up voter registration data and demographic data, adds ability for orgs to add own overlay data, as well as to share selected data with selected other orgs
has web services API to parts of platform (e.g., to check if someone registered to vote)
ntegration around voter activation network

sunlight foundation
big emphasis on APIs, particular REST and RESTful web services
hyperinnoation in terms of web services and working with data
"can create applicaton as fast as your comunications director can create press release"
move to permanent infrastructur

outside.in
"organizing the Internet by location"
"post-editorial newspaper"

Voter Genome Project
founders *not* institutional politicians
dems have won on conectivity, lost on proprietary tools
cost/vote too high ($12/vote in 2004, vs. $3/vote for GOP)

"do not have system adequate for national micro-targeting effort in 2008"
issue of public vs. private voting files
"control vs. capability"
fundamental voter/demograhics information should be open to all (dems + reps)
discussion of problems of data format standardization, cleaning up generated data

Q&A
hasn't been test where group has built large seed and allowed it be openly augmented
theinfo.org -- conversations about handling large data sets

Breakout session on anti-competitive moment
Ahmal (Peak sp?). 700MHz dscussion, lots of excitement but disappointing outcome
Skype guy: talking about Skype's petition to apply Carterforne-like rules to wireless
Mary Hodder: talking about Dabble and video search
almost every video company prohibits spidering
Dabble has made private deals, video compnaies won't deal with Google
Google froze market thru announcing video search capability that they couldn't actually do
also advising company in mobile space, doing opt-in localized ads
this company had same experience with google, but in response went for revenue first, got insulation from funding difficulties

free press guy: see anti-competition laws as not effective as solution for net neutraliy issue.

DOug Rushkoff:
""personal democracy" is an oxymoron"
illusion of pd has been mone of the main ostables"
concept of p d came from Renasicance
notion of the individual -> individual rights
branding is desocializing
"the brand dosn't want us to be engaged with one another, it wants us to be engaged with it."
the next ren will be ren of the group
cabn be un-incharge indiv or in-chrge collective
value comes from periphery
real glory in decent demo would be in tiny thing, glory is in the doing"
in contunial active participation
missed opportunies in media changes
text: instead of learning to read, people learned how to hear (other people reading)
printing press: got nation of readers, elite of writers
Internet: writing is not tool offered to us, medium offered to us is proramming medium
what is metaphor of programmng in real culture?
writing is like voting
"seeing our world an open source proposition"
social construction of people just like us
"democracy is a participatory event"

Morley Winograd (w Michael Hais): rise of a civic generartion
"millenial makeover"
(1982 - 2003), 1/3 of all Americans
~40M mill eleigble to vote in 2008
48% turnout 18-29 in 2004 (vs. 68% 30 and older)
based on "Generations" and "Fourth Turning"
four American generational archtype

Larry Lessig
1. rely too much on "every 4 year" syndrome
fall to sllep in between
2. founders obsessed with "independence" ("lack of dependence)
"independent representatives"
but failed, corruption was rampant
there is no golden past
even though indivudlas better, problem of corruption is much worse
because govt more significant and pervasive
"return from reuglation higher than return from competition"
"88% of people in LL district believe money buys results
this is dependency that our framers were worried about
not Madison's problem (democracy leading to people wanting to raid public treasury)
but our problem is rich milking govt

so what?
what is the cost of this kind of corruption?
pirvate vs.public funding of elections
example for (libertarian) right: telecommunications act
Congress didn't want to deregulate Internet services because can't raise money
extortion via regulation
examples for left: getting the easy cases wrong
copyright extension
nutrition: USDA recommendation 25% of caloric intkae coming from sugar
global warming

core problem is destroys conditions for trust
alteplex example, Genetech $11 controbt to AHPA
"monye destroys the opportunity for trust"

4. "need more than thursdays", more than every 4 years, need more than "hope"
need to change congress
bipartisan reform movement
focus on money representation integrity

opportunity to pledge to ideals
i. no $$ from lobbyists/PCAs
ii. reform earmarks
iii. support public finance of public elections
iv. total transparency

end.
there is a flaw at the core of the people's house, a kind of dependency
need to break our dependency on 4-year focus
not the most important problem, just the first problem


Johnathan Adelstein (FCC commissioner)
broadband policy important to future of economy
key to many issues: in-sourceing, health care, helping disabled

Steven Clift 
Examples from other countries: Mongolia, UK, Japan, Queensland, Korea, Estonia ("today I decide")
(democracy.gov is propaganda site)
everything should be online unless the law says otherwise

lessons:
1. govt agencies will not open themseleves up
we need to demand things
("we are #1 in making noise and raising money")
need to get pulic commitments before elections
2. need updated open meeting laws
3. need to invest in e-democracy tools in govt, e.g. notifications
4. need version of public hearings online
5. need more porojects like openhouse program (sunlight foundation)
6. ....

Sheila Campbell: USA.gov
close to $24K govt web sites
problems:
1. marginal govt sites 
2. web sites as agency PR vehicles
Focus on what people want: be task oriented


breakout on design principles
Q. should govt provide better (web) interfaces or concentrate on providing data to third parties
Sheila Campbell: govt should definitely provide structured data, focusing on key applications
Dan ?: the best web sites are the ones that have data available in raw form and then have good presentation layer
SC: what people often need is task-oriented information -- how to move thru process
Q. any attempt to have laws interpeted in ways people could read them?
Sara (of Knowledge as Power):  ...

Breakout on Thinktanking 2.0

Robert BLuey: recaptiulates history of Heritage Foundation.
HF has ~350K members, shooting for 1M
process of policy research still much as it was (DC-centric)

Peter Leyden (New Politics Institute): 
small donor funding of think tanks is prob wave of future

AF: any issues rspond better to new networking tools?

RB: doing road trip (?) with left/prog think tanks on fiscal issues

AF: tension between need for expertise and power of crowdsourcing
what role would c.s. play for t.t.?

PL: need to meld bet of both worlds
need a mechanism to first get big ideas going, then web-based way to refine ideas, then web-based ways to get broad-based support around ideas

AF: take an issue and walk us through how it would work

PL: example: energy
start by gathering transformative ideas that are not understood in country and DC
ex: company that can reduce of solar panels by order of magnitude
then put ideas out there and get people challenging ideas, adding info, then vuilding olitical support on the way

AF: found young have reat alienation rom politics and policy
are you seeing y.p. interested in this?
tension between youn turks who founded HF and young turks

RB: Quite a few youn people at HF. Example: tapped into guy to do web video and vlogging
tension? not a whole lot.
think within next 5-10 years leaders of conservative orgs retiring
generational changeover

AF: ...

Audience member: CAP as doing idea propgation not just generation

PL: need to look at what is problem we are trying to solve
unprecendented set of challenges now, possibility of fundamental restructuring
how would you apply todays's resource to these challenges?
traditional model was to bring smart people together in one place
need to look at parallel processing of a sort

RB: with entitlements, people who didn't agree came together to put together on framework
but then problem gets to be in details

Q: where does pulic lie in this process? you
re putting it after someone comes up with great ideas

PL: valid concern. People get sidetracked by term "think tank"
disintermediation in this space: if it was obvious what to do, could go direct from public to politicians
role for think tanks: need to generate options, do basic research

Q: how to form a think tank?

RB: what is goal: to influence Congress? agency in executive branch?
idea of virtual think tank
but still need money

Q: if we go to paradigm of mal donors, hw does that change topics t.t.s ook at?

PL: could imagine lots of people setting agenda for tt, prioritizing issues, funding specific studies

Q. ... mention of debategraph
