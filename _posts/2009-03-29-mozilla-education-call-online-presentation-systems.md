For [this weekâ€™s instance](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/StatusMeetings/2009-03-30) of our [weekly Mozilla Education call](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/StatusMeetings) I'll be talking about various systems for doing online presentations and related activities (e.g., screen sharing, attendee chat, audio and video broadcast, and so on), including [Dimdim](http://www.dimdim.com/), [WebEx](http://www.webex.com/), [GoToMeeting](http://www.gotomeeting.com/), [ePresence](http://epresence.tv/), MegaMeeting.com, and [OpenMeetings](http://code.google.com/p/openmeetings/); feel free to also share your experiences with these and other systems. I'll be doing the presentation itself using one such system, [Dimdim](http://www.dimdim.com/); click on "Join Meeting", and enter the meeting room as "hecker" and the ID as "mozillaeducation". However please use the standard [Mozilla Education teleconference system](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Education/StatusMeetings) for the call itself.
