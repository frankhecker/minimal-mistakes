---

Are you a current or past resident of Howard County, Maryland? Have
you ever wondered how Howard County’s current system of local
government came into being? If so, my book _Dividing Howard_ is for
you. It tells the story of Howard County politics of the last fifty
years, going all the way back to the creation of the planned community
of Columbia, viewed through the prism of the establishment of the
Howard County Council and the subsequent creation and redrawing of
County Council districts.

It’s an entertaining and even exciting story that includes heated
disputes between the Democratic and Republican parties, internal
fights between factions within the Democratic party, epic battles for
political power between Columbia and the rest of the county, both
failed and successful petition drives and referendums, multiple court
cases (including one featuring a former U.S. attorney general), and
provocative quotes from Howard County politicians past and
present. It’s a must for anyone interested in Howard County politics
or Maryland politics in general.

_Dividing_ Howard is available as an ebook [for the Kindle from
Amazon.com][amazon] and [for the Nook from Barnes and Noble][bn], for
$0.99. All royalties from the book go to [Voices for Children][], the
Court Appointed Special Advocate (CASA) program in Howard
