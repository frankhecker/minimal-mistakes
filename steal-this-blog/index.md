excerpt: "You’re free to reuse anything I write on this blog."

This blog represents my personal opinions only and has nothing to do
with my paid employment; I don’t make any money from it, and never
expect to. I’ve done a lot of work related to software licensing as
part of the [Mozilla relicensing project][] and when I worked at
[CollabNet][]. As a result of enduring endess wrangling about
licensing terms I’ve been put off complex licensing schemes, and
prefer to make my own works available under very liberal terms.

For my writings I typically use the [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0
Unported license][cc-attrib].  For software I prefer use of the [MIT
license] as being the most simple and easy-to-understand license in
common use, and the one least likely to cause issues for others who
want to reuse my software. Note that there are some minor exceptions
to the above for older works. However if for some reason you want to
reuse one of my works under a different license just send me a
request; I’ll almost certainly grant you whatever permissions you
require.

One thing I’ve noticed with Creative Commons, open source and free
software licensing is that many people don’t seem to take the licenses
at face value, but are always asking questions about what they can and
can’t do, even when the issue is directly addressed by the license
itself. Here’s a “mini-FAQ” intended to forestall such questions:

* “Do I need to ask your permission before I do something with your
  writings or your software?” No, you do not. However I’d appreciate
  it if you’d send me an email message if you find anything I’ve
  created to be of enough interest to you that you’re motivated to
  redistribute or reuse it; that will help motivate me to keep
  creating new stuff.
* “What sort of things can I do with your writings or software?”
  Pretty much anything you’d like to: You can redistribute my writings
  or software to anyone you wish, use my software for any legal
  purpose, translate my writings to other languages, make various
  modifications to my writings or software and redistribute the
  modified works, create your own works that incorporate portions of
  my writings or software, and so on.
* “Can I use your writings or software in commercial products like
  books, newspapers, magazines, or proprietary software?” Yes, you
  can, and you don’t have to pay me a cent. However if you’d like me
  to enhance something I’ve written or create new related material
  then I might be willing to do that for a fee, depending on the
  nature of the project and whether my work situation permits me to do
  so.
* “Can I replicate your blog posts in my own feed aggregator or on my
  ad-supported web site?” Yes, as long as you comply with the license
  terms. See also the answer to the previous questions.
* “If I use your writings or software in creating my own works, what
  do I need to do in order to comply with your license terms?” Not
  much at all: If you use brief extracts then you don’t need to do
  anything at all; this includes quoting material in blog postings,
  magazine articles, books and other contexts that would traditionally
  be considered fair use. (However both common courtesy and scholarly
  tradition would dictate that you attribute the material to me.) If
  you redistribute entire articles or source code files, or
  incorporate substantial portions of them in your own work, then the
  license terms require that you provide appropriate attribution and
  otherwise comply with the minimal terms of the licenses in
  question. For typical references to my writings (e.g., in your own
  blog posts) you can simply reference my name and provide a link to
  my original page or pages.
