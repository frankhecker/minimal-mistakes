_Civility and Truth_ is a personal blog focusing on Howard County,
Maryland, and the world beyond. Every week a new post will focus on
one of the following areas:

* Howard County issues and events
* Analysis of data relating to Howard County
* Politics and public affairs
* Culture and the arts

My goal in writing this blog is, first, to provide information of
interest to that very small subset of Howard County residents who have
traditionally been readers of my blog, and, second, to provide myself
with an outlet for my opinions about matters beyond the county that
are of interest to me, and may occasionally be of interest to my
readers as well. In tone I will strive to be civil and non-partisan,
in topics I will mostly ignore day-to-day goings-on and focus on
longer-term issues relevant to the county, Maryland, the US, and the
world, and in approach I will rely as much as possible on hard data
and confirmed facts.

The name of this blog comes from Jane Austen’s _[Pride and
Prejudice][]_.  As her heroine Elizabeth Bennett is subjected to the
pompous bloviations of her former would-be suitor, Mr. Collins, in
response she “tried to unite civility and truth in a few short
sentences.”  My task is much easier. The people I know in Howard
County are considerably nicer and more down-to-earth than Mr. Collins,
and I have space to use as many sentences as I please. However I found
the idea of uniting civility and truth a congenial one, and the
shout-out to the Howard County Library System’s “[Choose Civility][]”
campaign was too good to resist.

_Civility and Truth_ is built using the [Jekyll][] static site
generator and Michael Rose’s [Minimal Mistakes][] responsive Jekyll
theme, designed to look good and load quickly on smartphones, tablets,
and desktop PCs. It uses Arne Eilermann’s [jekyll-tagging][] plugin to
provide tags for each post, and Nikita Lebedev’s [fork][] of Lawrence
Woodman’s [related_posts] plugin to list posts related to a given post
based on tags they have in common. It supports display of mathematical
notation using [MathJax][], although at present that support does not
work in the Atom feed.

I have tried to have URLs for older blog posts at frankhecker.com be
redirected to this blog, so that existing links will continue to
work. If you find any links that produce errors please notify me at
frank@frankhecker.com.

One major change from my older blog is that I did not implement a
commenting system for this blog. I got very few comments on my older
blog and most of the ones I did get were spam, so I decided that the
work of allowing comments wasn’t worth the trouble. I will post
notices of new _Civility and Truth_ blog posts on [Twitter][] and
[Facebook][], and you can make comments in either place if you wish.
